### Assistant:
- **Complete Dataset:** Step 11: Step 9: Cut Openings for Faucet and Shower Head
- Eventually you will need to cut out the hole for your faucet and shower handle. We used an [angle grinder](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-18-Volt-ONE-Cordless-4-1-2-in-Angle-Grinder-Tool-Only-P421/100519983) to cut the tile to the shape we wanted BEFORE we put the tile on the wall. The Home Depot also sells [diamond hole saws](https://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-1-3-8-in-Pro-Wet-Dry-Diamond-Hole-Saw-10087Q/205553933), but we weren’t worried about making it pretty, since our [faucet handle](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Pfister-Venturi-Single-Handle-1-Spray-Tub-and-Shower-Faucet-in-Spot-Defense-Brushed-Nickel-Valve-Included-8P8-WS2VNSGS/300721652) has a big plate to cover any mistakes we made. You’ll need to do the same thing for your shower head.
- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-13.jpg)
- Continue tiling until you get to the height you want your shower. Since our basement ceilings aren’t very high, we knew we wanted our shower to go to the ceiling. We had to cut the last tile to fit up to the ceiling. If you aren’t tiling up to the ceiling, I suggest finishing off your edge with [Schluter tile edging](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Schluter-Jolly-Bright-Black-Anodized-Aluminum-1-2-in-x-8-ft-2-1-2-in-Metal-Tile-Edging-Trim-A125AGSG/202602072).
- After I paint the ceiling, I will apply a layer of caulk where my ceiling meets my tile. That way, we know the seam is watertight and we don’t have to worry about water or vapor getting behind the tile at the top. You can get [caulk that matches your grout](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-Polyblend-09-Natural-Gray-10-5-oz-Sanded-Ceramic-Tile-Caulk-PC0910S/100678060), so that will help it look really nice at the top. But like I said, that will wait until after I paint the ceiling, which I didn’t do yet, because I knew I would probably get grout and thinset on it.

- **Complete Dataset:** Step 2: Prep a Room for Painting
- Remove all furniture and fixtures, including lights, blinds, HVAC registers and outlet covers.
- Carefully inspect surfaces for cracks, holes, dents or other imperfections.
- Use a putty knife and lightweight [spackling compound](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Patching-Repair-Spackle/N-5yc1vZ2fkpczs) to fill and repair holes and cover imperfections.
- Remove excess spackling with the [putty knife.](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Tools-Putty-Knives/N-5yc1vZci2c) Allow to dry following manufacturer's instructions before painting.
- Use a small piece of fine [220-grit sandpaper](/b/Building-Materials-Drywall-Drywall-Tools-Drywall-Sanding-Tools-Drywall-Sand-Paper/N-5yc1vZ2fkpcxw) or a sanding sponge to smooth the repaired areas flush with the surface. Some surfaces might require a specific sandpaper. Be sure to read the manufacturer's guidelines before sanding.
- Wipe surfaces clean with a damp towel or sponge and let dry. A heavy-duty cleaner may help to remove dirt and grease from the walls and trim. Be sure to keep rags, buckets, water and paint sticks nearby for mixing. These will also come in handy for cleanup and mixing afterward.
- Wear old clothes and a hat while painting.
- Make sure you have rubber gloves and eye protection on hand.
- Whenever you start any interior house painting project, always work in a properly ventilated space. You must open all windows and doors. You should also use fans and proper safety gear, like a [respirator mask](/b/Safety-Equipment-Respirator-Masks/N-5yc1vZc25k) and ventilator. This keeps the area safe and free of paint particles, especially with strong fumes.

- **Complete Dataset:** Step 5: Practice Using a Paint Sprayer
- Fill the sprayer’s reservoir with paint and spray a large scrap of cardboard propped up on a wall. Scraps of drywall also work fine to practice on. Take your time learning how to use a paint sprayer and have several pieces of scrap material on hand.
- Try various vertical and horizontal spraying movements to get a consistent pattern of paint onto the surface of the scrap material. You want the surface to achieve a uniform look when using a paint sprayer.
- Holding the spray gun close to a surface applies more paint and creates a narrower spray pattern. Practice holding the spray gun closer to the surface for that result.
- Holding the gun farther away from the surface creates a thinner coat of paint and a wider spray pattern. Work on how to use a paint sprayer to create that result, as well.
- If you hold the sprayer too far away, the paint can dry before it reaches the surface. If that happens, you might need to respray the surface and take even more time to complete the project. Also, your paint supply won’t last as long.

### Assistant:
- **Complete Dataset:** Step 6: Types of Couch Fabrics and Materials
- Velvet: Luxury fabric. Offers softness and durability.
- Suede: A stylish, comfortable and durable fabric. Cleaning requires more effort.
- Leather: Popular, sophisticated and long-lasting. Available in many colors and textures. [Leather sofas and couches](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-Sofas-Couches/Leather/N-5yc1vZc7oyZ1z0jjgr) are easily cleaned, with stain-resistant finishes. Consider vinyl, a synthetic, more durable and cost-effective alternative.
- Twill: A tightly woven cotton fabric. Soft, casual and durable. Easily cleaned.
- Boucle: A looped yarn fabric. Soft, nubby texture. Stylish, casual and fun. Easily maintained.
- Textured weave: Soft and nubby like boucle, but chunkier and stronger. Offers an attractive, natural feel. Works well in busy homes.
- Linen: Provides a soft texture cool to the touch. Simple clean-up.
- Cotton: Good, breezy linen alternative. Can be treated and resist stains.
- Denim: A durable cotton alternative. Absorbs stains and colors faster. Resists pilling, the breakdown of fabric fibers, which causes small fuzzballs.
- Canvas: Another durable cotton alternative. Offers a more casual and relaxed style.
- Chenille: Has a soft, silky and plush feel, like velvet. Durable, unless exposed to direct sunlight, so place sofas away from windows.
- Wool and wool blends: Durable, with little wrinkling or piling. Easily spot-cleaned or vacuumed. Recommended for homes with children. Good heat retention.
- Acrylic: A synthetic wool. Resists wear and tear, fading, wrinkling and discoloration.
- Polyester: A non-allergenic, synthetic fiber that looks and feels like leather. [Polyester sofas and couches](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-Sofas-Couches/Polyester/N-5yc1vZc7oyZ1z0jjjl) can resist stains and damage more than some natural materials. Alternatives include nylon and olefin, which resist stains and damage.

What is Step 2 for Removing Wallpaper?

### Assistant:
- **Complete Dataset:** Step 2: Choose a Wallpaper Removal Method
- Some newer homes use [removable wallpaper](/b/Home-Decor-Wallpaper/Peel-Stick-Removable/N-5yc1vZbc0qZ1z1du5h), also called temporary wallpaper. Use a scraper or putty knife to loosen an edge of the wallpaper at the corner of a room and carefully try to pull off a strip. Removable wallpaper should peel off easily.
- Strippable wallpaper is designed to last longer than removable wallpaper, but softens easily when soaked with hot water.
- Wallpapers designed to be water resistant or washable, such as vinyl wallpapers, need a stronger method, such as a chemical [wallpaper remover](/b/Paint-Wallpaper-Remover/N-5yc1vZ2fkot80).
- Gel removers are less messy than liquid removers and can be more effective in removing wallpaper that has been applied to unprimed drywall or has used clay-based adhesives.
- Wallpaper steamers can be used on any wallpaper and may be the only recourse with old, stubborn wallpapers that are hard to remove. Buying or renting a steamer may be more expensive than other methods.

### Assistant:
Step 2: Plan Wallpaper Removal
- Plan how to remove wallpaper from each room. Consider the type of wallpaper and the condition of the walls.
- Decide on the best method for removing wallpaper. If the wallpaper is old and worn, you can use a wallpaper scraper. If the wallpaper is newer and has a paper backing, you may need to use a chemical remover or a steamer.
- If you need to remove wallpaper from a large area, such as a ceiling or a large section of a wall, you may need to use a specialized tool, such as a wallpaper scraper or a wallpaper peeler. These tools are designed to remove wallpaper from large areas without damaging the underlying wall.
- If you need to remove wallpaper from a small area

- We’re going for something classic yet chic—penny tile…but with a twist! I am adding a border and words in the middle! First, I did a dry fit, laying all the tile out, except for the letters – that will come later. After I was confident in my layout, I started removing a row of tiles in the back of the bathroom. I used a [trowel](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Anvil-3-16-in-x-5-32-in-V-Notch-Economy-Flooring-Trowel-10115ANV/310779434 "Anvil 3/16 in. x 5/32 in. V-Notch Economy Flooring Trowel") to spread [thinset](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-SimpleSet-3-1-2-Gal-White-Premixed-Thinset-Mortar-STTSW3/100678061 "Custom Building Products SimpleSet 3 1/2 Gal. White Premixed Thinset Mortar") onto the concrete. I then carefully placed my tiles back and pressed them into the thinset. You want to make sure you don’t use too much thinset, because it will seep through the tiles. Also, make sure you check your tiles CONSTANTLY to assure you have what we call “the flower” or else you could end up with a floor that shows the square sheets of penny tile. I removed the tiles, added thinset and secured them row by row until the entire room was done. I let this dry overnight. For the letters, I first placed the [black penny tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/p/MSI-Nero-Penny-Round-12-in-x-13-in-Matte-Porcelain-Mesh-Mounted-Mosaic-Tile-14-4-sq-ft-case-PT-PENRD-NEROM/306065589 "MSI Nero Penny Round 12 in. x 13 in. Matte Porcelain Mesh-Mounted Mosaic Tile 14.4 sq. ft. / case") on top of the [white](https://www.homedepot.com/p/MSI-Penny-Round-Bianco-12-in-x-13-in-x-6-mm-Matte-Porcelain-Mesh-Mounted-Mosaic-Tile-14-4-sq-ft-case-PT-PENRD-BIAM/306065585 "MSI Penny Round Bianco 12 in. x 13 in. x 6 mm Matte Porcelain Mesh-Mounted Mosaic Tile \(14.4 sq. ft. / case\)") so I could visualize the spacing. Then I marked each of the white tiles with a little dot, so I knew which ones to remove. I used a flat head screwdriver and popped up the marked tiles. Once they were up, I cleaned out any excess dried thinset. I then added the black penny tiles. To do this, I put thinset into a Ziplock bag and cut the tip (like you would apply icing on a cake). This allowed me to squeeze out a little on each tile and press onto the floor. Read the label on your thinset to determine how long it needs to dry before grouting. Once dry, you are ready for [grout](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-SimpleGrout-640-Arctic-White-1-gal-Pre-Mixed-Grout-PMG6401-2/319229605 "Custom Building Products SimpleGrout #640 Arctic White 1 gal.

Using a [grout float](https://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-4-in-x-10-5-in-XL-Non-Stick-Gum-Rubber-Grout-Float-with-Wood-Handle-10070/310829257 "QEP 4 in. x 10.5 in. XL Non-Stick Gum Rubber Grout Float with Wood Handle"), scoop the grout out and press it into the tile. Make sure you angle the grout float to remove excess grout. Do this in small areas as you do not want to leave the grout on the tile for too long. Use water and sponges to wipe off any remaining excess grout. Also, be sure to refresh your water constantly, if it looks “milky” the grout could adhere to the top of your tile, making your end project look very messy. Once the entire floor is grouted, refer to the products suggested drying time. If you have any grout haze, you can use a grout haze remover. Once you’re happy with the look of your tile and grout, go ahead and seal it.

What is Step 8 for Creating a Flex Space?

### Assistant:
- **Complete Dataset:** Step 8: Beverage Station
- ![A coffee and tea station with a microwave and small refrigerator nearby.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/mjNNMrw1eTedHFLK1eZf8A/jvGUMO15T-kHUowfR4QFQg/Original%20file/how-to-create-a-flex-space-section-7-A.jpg)
- A coffee or tea station is perfect for morning coffee, coffee breaks and tea time. This area could be cozy, with a lounge chair and lamp for enjoying your hot – or iced – beverage. It can also be a well-stocked station off to the side of a larger area. Include storage for filters, bags of coffee, loose and bagged tea selections and anything your household members like to add to their drinks. You may want to make it house a water dispenser or bottled water, or it could even be a minibar for adult beverages. Don’t forget to use lighting that sets whatever mood you want your beverage area to complement.
- Flex spaces are a sensible use of extra space in your home. They can be dedicated or temporary, and the possibilities for their use are endless. When you’ve decided on how to create your space, The Home Depot’s [Home Organization Services](https://www.homedepot.com/services/c/home-organization/22ef3e97b) can help you design it perfectly.

- Wallpaper is another fun way to really make a statement with your space. I personally love going bold when it comes to wallpaper. I had this fun idea to add wallpaper to the shelves of my office cabinets. The Home Depot has so many wallpaper options to choose from and they have a wallpaper calculator that helps you calculate just how much wallpaper you need.
- After seeing the wallpaper close-up, I decided to add it to a blank wall instead of adding it to the shelves, so I was able to add the wall measurements to the wallpaper calculator and figure out just how much I needed for this project.

- All types of vinyl flooring  
- Vinyl can be installed in rolls or in a variety of different shapes, sizes and install methods. These install methods  
- Vinyl finishes include no-wax, urethane or enhanced urethane. Each offers stain-resistance and a nice shine that does not require polishing or buffing.

The wear layer makes the flooring waterproof, scratch- and/or stain-resistant. Thickness ranges between 4 to 40 millimeters, with a thicker wear layer making more sense for homes with pets, kids and high traffic.

- **Complete Dataset:** Step 6: Prepping the Bathroom Walls and Floors
- Before we can get to the fun stuff, we have to prep everything. Not the most fun part of a renovation, but it really is important. I started by removing any existing screws from the walls. I am going to add new [pendant lights](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Renee-1-Light-Aged-Brass-and-Black-Pendant-Light-with-Opal-Glossy-Shade-H344701-AGB-BK/311691187 "Renee 1-Light Aged Brass and Black Pendant Light with Opal Glossy Shade") above the vanity, so I had my electrician come and rewire the lighting so the lights could be hung from the ceiling. Next, I patched all my holes. You will want to patch any holes or imperfections with spackle, let dry, repeat if needed and sand until smooth. Even if you are covering the walls with wallpaper, they need to be smooth first, otherwise you will see imperfections through the wallpaper. After patching, make sure to prime your walls. Wallpaper will not stick to drywall or spackle. If you are painting your walls, you will still need to prime to ensure the paint covers evenly. You’ll want to check the condition of the subfloor to ensure it’s in good shape before moving on to your new flooring choice. Since we are working in the basement, I’m dealing with concrete so that makes it easy on me! Since there was carpet in this bathroom a zillion years ago (gross I know), I did have to scrape up some residue. I used my [Husky 15-in-one tool](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-15-in-1-Painters-Multi-Tool-with-Stainless-Steel-Blade-91004/326354449 "Husky 15-in-1 Painters Multi-Tool with Stainless Steel Blade") and everything came up easily.

- As a DIY-er and homeowner, I’m always on the lookout for products that would not only look great in our home but are also practical for our family and are made to last.
- When the time came to upgrade our kitchen and dining room floors, [LifeProof Sterling Oak 8.7 in. x 47.6 in. Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Lifeproof-Sterling-Oak-8-7-in-W-x-47-6-in-L-Luxury-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring-20-06-sq-ft-case-I966106L/300699284) from The Home Depot was the clear choice for us. Allow me to share some reasons why!
- ![In store LifeProof flooring display](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/lifeproof-luxury-vinyl-plank-flooring-image-2.jpg)
- Because of the seemingly endless amount of choices out there, shopping for flooring can be a daunting task. With that said, you can count on The Home Depot to provide expert knowledge and insight that’s only a click, phone call or short drive away. In addition to my research online, The Home Depot’s large LifeProof flooring display really helped me make a great flooring decision for our family.
- We are a large family that includes four very energetic kids ranging from 11 to 4. When it comes to the needs of our family, health is the number one concern. When I discovered that LifeProof Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring has no phthalates or formaldehyde, it went to the top of my list of choices.
- Like most families with kids, we are also a family of spills! Drink spills happen every day, all day for us. Sometimes, these spills aren’t reported to mom and dad. We find out about them when we discover the bottom of our socks are wet.
- ![A family sitting on LifeProof flooring boxes](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/lifeproof-luxury-vinyl-plank-flooring-image-3.jpg)
- Our new LifeProof Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring, which is exclusive to The Home Depot, is 100% waterproof, which gives mom and dad assurance that we won’t have to deal with warped floors every time a drink is knocked over. Clean-up is as simple as using a dust mop, vacuum, or a pH-neutral cleaner. It’s also scratch-resistant, which is nice. But we fully expect to deal with marks and scratches from our VERY active kiddos.

What is Step 10 for Tiling a Basement Shower?

### Assistant:
- **Complete Dataset:** Step 10: Step 8: Add Shelves
- One of the advantages to building your own shower is that you can add as many shelves as you want! And you know what I always say, “a shower can never have too many shelves”- just kidding, I never say that. But really, I do like a lot of shelves in the shower so soap and shampoo bottles don’t end up on the floor.
- We installed three of these cool [corner shelves](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Bath-Accessories-White-8-in-x-8-in-Ceramic-Wall-Mounted-Corner-Shelf-0100BA7801P/100674432). I’m not going to lie, I was intimidated by these shelves when I first saw them. They are pretty heavy duty, and I thought there was no way they were going to stay on the wall with just thinset. But I was wrong! They are really amazing and super easy to install.
- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-12.jpg)
- The shelf actually sits on the tile below it, and the tile above it slides behind the shelf, so it stays put! When we got to the row where we wanted the shelf, we installed the shelf first, with a layer of thinset, then tiled the row meeting up to it. That way we knew exactly what size to cut our tile. We did have to cut a couple of tiles in sort of an L-shape to have it fit up to the shelf, but the coolest part is that the tile slides in behind the shelf, so you can’t see the edge of the cut tile behind it.
- Our bottom shelf was installed about 2 feet from the shower floor, and the top shelves just shy of 4 feet from the shower floor.
- We were big fans of [these shelves](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Bath-Accessories-White-8-in-x-8-in-Ceramic-Wall-Mounted-Corner-Shelf-0100BA7801P/100674432).

What is Step 4 for Removing Wallpaper?

### Assistant:
- **Complete Dataset:** Step 4: How to Remove Wallpaper With Liquid
- Before using liquid remover, water-resistant wallpaper should be scored or perforated so the remover will be able to contact the adhesive between the paper and the wall. Roller-style wallpaper scorers are extremely effective at puncturing the wallpaper with dozens of tiny holes. Use light pressure when running the scorer over the wall to avoid scratching the wall. Blade-based wallpaper scorers are cheaper but slice lines into the wallpaper and are less effective.
- Apply the liquid remover with a spray bottle for quick coverage over a larger area, but use a sponge or other tool in corners or places where precision is required.
- Allow the solution to soak the wall as specified by the manufacturer’s instructions.
- Once the liquid remover has softened the adhesive, peel off the paper or use a [paint scraper](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Tools-Paint-Scrapers/Paint-Scrapers/N-5yc1vZci29Z1z0t5dr) or putty knife to remove it.

- A key step when ordering furniture is ensuring that you will be able to get the furniture inside your home once delivered. Always measure doorways and stairways before placing your furniture order.
- Know the height, width and depth for the furniture that you want in your space. This can be found in the product details in the online description.
- Measure doorways, pathways and stairways to your home. If there are elevators and hallways, get those measurements, too, including the elevator door opening. These measurements must be greater than the furniture dimensions in order for the furniture to be moved into your space.
- When measuring, you’ll want to use the interior measurement of the doorways, passageways and hallways. Note the placement of architectural details like doorknobs, light fixtures and trim like chair rail on your sketch.
- Tip: Measure twice for accuracy. Ask a friend to help with running the tape measure and making sketches.
- Properly measuring your room for furniture will help you design a comfortable living space and will save aggravation with furniture delivery.
- With proper planning and precise measurements, you can get the right size furniture for your space. Start by measuring the entryway for delivery. Always measure twice to avoid issues down the road.

- **Complete Dataset:** Step 2: What is Backer Board?
- [Cement board](/b/Building-Materials-Drywall-Cement-Boards/N-5yc1vZcb0f), often referred to as backer board, is a thin layer of concrete with fiberglass mesh on both sides. It’s available in sheets of many sizes. Most projects need 3-foot by 5-foot sheets.
- Whenever you’re laying tile on a wood subfloor, you need to first install cement backer board. Backer board prevents leaks and water damage that could harm your flooring and the structure of your home. Unlike wood or drywall sub-surfaces, cement backer board will not rot, warp or grow mold and mildew when exposed to water. That’s the main reason they’re a go-to choice for permanent installations like this.
- Another reason you’ll need to work with cement backer board is that it’s never safe to install new tiles over existing tiles. You also can’t safely install tile flooring over plywood subfloor or onto an unprotected wood floor. If you did, there'd be a serious risk of rot, water damage, warping and mold. Plus, your tile and grout would likely crack.

- **Complete Dataset:** Step 8: Add a Pattern
- Find a stencil that suits the size of your tiles. Before you start adding the pattern to your tiles, practice stencil painting on a piece of cardboard.  
- Start with a clean tile floor. Priming the tile will help the stencil paint stick to it.
- Plan the pattern so it will match the tiled space you want to paint. Use painter’s tape to cover the edges of the area.
- Begin stenciling on one of the edges. Work on one tile at a time. Lay the stencil on the tile. Use painter’s tape to secure the stencil. You can apply the paint with a brush or a sponge.  
- The key to pretty stenciling is using the right amount of paint. Dab a little paint onto the stencil and tile at a time, adding more if you need to.
- When you’re done painting the pattern, allow plenty of time to let it dry. Depending on how you’re working, you may need to let one stencil dry before adding the next.

What is Step 5 for Engineered Wood Flooring Selection?

### Assistant:
- **Complete Dataset:** Step 5: Benefits of Engineered Wood Flooring
- Attractive appearance: To the untrained eye, engineered wood is indistinguishable from solid hardwood. Plus, engineered wood flooring typically is available in a vast variety of colors, textures and sizes.
- Durable: Engineered wood flooring has a stable construction that withstands natural temperature and moisture changes. Most types can be refinished at least once if they get too damaged.
- Light-resistant: Most types of engineered wood floors are UV-resistant, so they won’t fade from the sun.
- Mold-resistant: While not all types of engineered wood floors are fully waterproof, engineered wood is more waterproof than other flooring materials. Not only does it resist warping and water damage, it also resists mold growth.
- Easy to maintain: Engineered wood floors are easy to clean and are usually pre-finished with a protective coating that doesn’t require additional coats of finish or shine.
- Multiple installation options: Unlike solid hardwood, engineered wood floors can be installed below-grade, over concrete subfloors and heated floors. They can also be installed with multiple different methods, which are covered in the next section.
- Lower cost: Engineered wood flooring is slightly more budget friendly per square foot than solid hardwood, while still looking like solid hardwood.

- On some wall coverings, especially vinyl-coated styles, the outer layer may simply pull away from the paper backing, leaving only the paper and glue to be removed.
- Utility knives will come in handy when removing wallpaper borders and trim along cabinets.
- You can try mixing your own wallpaper remover solutions, using either 1/3 vinegar to 2/3 hot water or 1/4 fabric softener to 3/4 hot water. Apply with a sponge or spray bottle.
- Start at the top of the wall and work your way down when applying chemicals.
- After removing the wallpaper, clean and remove the excess adhesive by applying a solution of hot water and a small amount of trisodium phosphate (TSP). Wipe the walls with the cleaning solution, rinse with a sponge and clean water and towel dry.
- Use spackle or sandable filler to patch any nicks or gouges in the wall.

- Sweep regularly to remove dust, dirt, pet hair and other debris. You can use a vacuum so long as the vacuum doesn’t have a beater bar or has a “bare floor” setting. Otherwise, the vacuum may scuff the floor.
- Mop as needed or whenever the floors begin to look dull. Use a mop that’s damp, but not soaking wet to avoid water damage. Use a soft towel to dry any spots that are still wet a few minutes after mopping.
- Clean up spills and any water on the floor as soon as possible.
- For deep cleanings, use a [cleaner](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Supplies-Floor-Cleaners-Hardwood-Floor-Cleaners/N-5yc1vZcb40) that's safe for engineered wood flooring. Follow the cleaner’s manufacturer’s instructions for the best results.
- Don’t use cleaning products with ammonia, wax or oil.
- Use only soft materials like a towel or microfiber cleaning cloth when applying cleaner to your floor.
- Minimize the appearance of scratches and prevent more damage using a scratch concealer made for engineered wood flooring.
- Consider putting rugs, mats or felt furniture sliders underneath chairs or other frequently used furniture to prevent scuffs and scratches on your floor.

- ![Person measures a door opening](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-measure-a-room-for-furniture-2022-step-2.jpg)
- A key step when ordering furniture is ensuring that you will be able to get the furniture inside your home once delivered. Always measure doorways and stairways before placing your furniture order.
- Know the height, width and depth for the furniture that you want in your space. This can be found in the product details in the online description.
- Measure doorways, pathways and stairways to your home. If there are elevators and hallways, get those measurements, too, including the elevator door opening. These measurements must be greater than the furniture dimensions in order for the furniture to be moved into your space.
- When measuring, you’ll want to use the interior measurement of the doorways, passageways and hallways. Note the placement of architectural details like doorknobs, light fixtures and trim like chair rail on your sketch.
- Tip: Measure twice for accuracy. Ask a friend to help with running the tape measure and making sketches.
- Properly measuring your room for furniture will help you design a comfortable living space and will save aggravation with furniture delivery.
- With proper planning and precise measurements, you can get the right size furniture for your space. Start by measuring the entryway for delivery. Always measure twice to avoid issues down the road.
- Use [The Home Depot Mobile App](https://www.homedepot.com/c/SF_Mobile_Shopping) to locate products and check inventory. We'll take you to the exact aisle and bay. The Home Depot delivers [online orders](https://www.homedepot.com/c/About_Your_Online_Order) when and where you need them.

- You may want to follow the process of "edging painting." This involves cutting in the wall's edges before painting rolling or painting the entire wall. Doing so prevents the borders from drying before you finish painting the wall. It also keeps the sheen uniform. If edging, use an angled brush to apply a thick coat.
- Choose the right roller cover for your wall surface and place it onto your [paint roller](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Rollers/N-5yc1vZaqpy). For smooth ceilings, use a low nap roller. For a textured ceiling, use a thicker roller, with a 1/2-inch or 3/4-inch nap.
- Pour primer into a paint tray.
- Dip the roller into the paint, making sure it’s completely covered.
- Roll the paint roller over the ridged area of the [paint tray](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Trays-and-Liners/N-5yc1vZaqcd) a few times to remove excess paint.
- With a fully loaded paint roller, work top to bottom. Roll it back and forth across the wall in a series of V- or W-shaped strokes.
- Roll in one section at a time, moving from top to bottom and from one side of the wall to the other. The goal is to achieve even coverage, with no drips. Press lightly on the roller to prevent drips and lines.
- Reload the roller and paint the next section. Cover only as much as you can finish while the primer is still wet. Overlap areas of wet primer only.

What is Step 11 for Painting a Room?

### Assistant:
- **Complete Dataset:** Step 11: Using a Paint Sprayer
- When picking a paint, it should flow smoothly through the sprayer. Airless paint sprayer rentals use oil-based paints. They’re better than latex or water-based paints, which can be thicker and clog machines.
- Have all necessary painting tools and equipment ready before starting a project. Besides the normal materials, you may need special items. For instance, a fiberglass twin stepladder or scaffold set may help for higher walls and ceilings. If you have to paint large, open indoor areas, such as warehouses, The Home Depot has scissor lifts for rent that can rise up to 40 feet.
- Be sure to follow the sprayer’s operations manual for all steps. Practice first, using a piece of scrap drywall or cardboard. This will allow you to use the sprayer correctly, using a smooth, back-and-forth motion. You can also figure out the distance needed for proper coverage.
- Always begin your stroke movement before using the trigger to release paint. Then, end the stroke after releasing the trigger. Doing this prevents paint from building up on the surface. Regularly wiping your paint sprayer nozzle with a rag prevents clogging.
- When using a sprayer, first paint corners and complex areas. You can then move on to flat surfaces, working top to bottom.
- Once your project is completed, let the paint dry for 24-48 hours. Next, remove the painter’s tape and drop cloths. You can then move your furniture back into the room and continue designing.
- Make sure you return your paint sprayer rental clean. When finished, clean the entire paint sprayer, as per the operations manual. If work remains, pour the leftover paint back into the can and clean the machine before storing.

- **Complete Dataset:** Step 3: Engineered Wood vs. Solid Hardwood
- ![Alt Text Here](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/Vhzle8SxGqW3QgxFPrFIIQ/rXKngK9-dWsRBovc2wyb9g/Original%20file/best-engineered-hardwood-flooring-for-your-home-section-2.jpg)
- Solid hardwood flooring planks are made entirely from a single piece of hardwood. Engineered wood flooring planks, by contrast, are made up of several layers of composite wood, with a thin veneer of solid hardwood on top. Both are great flooring options, depending on your needs.
- Because its entire thickness is high quality wood, solid hardwood flooring can be sanded down and refinished many times. This ability gives it a much longer lifespan than engineered wood floors. With the right installation and care, solid hardwood can last a literal lifetime, anywhere from 30 to 100 years. However, solid hardwood is prone to warping from temperature and moisture changes, so it should only be installed above-grade. Wider solid hardwood planks may also need to be glued and nailed down to a wood subfloor to prevent movement.
- Engineered wood flooring can also be refinished if it has a thick hardwood veneer. Thinner veneers typically can’t be refinished, so the flooring only has a lifespan of up to 30 years. Thick veneers can help engineered wood flooring last up to 80 years. Engineered wood planks are also sturdier and less likely to warp over time, so they can be installed below-grade and over wood or concrete subfloors.
- When it comes to cost, solid hardwood is typically more expensive per square foot than engineered hardwood. Higher quality engineered hardwood can get as expensive as a mid- to upper-range solid hardwood, but the labor for installing either type of flooring is usually the same and makes up the bulk of the cost.
- Tip: Both engineered and solid hardwood floors can make a home more appealing to future buyers and add resale value.
