There are so many ways that you can update your space and give it a little flavor. Today, I’m going to walk you through three ways that you can update a space in your home to give it a whole new feel.

First, we start out with our blank canvas. Pick a room or a space that you’d like to change and utilize one or all of the following ways to update your space.

## Adding Shiplap Paneling

I always love using [shiplap paneling](https://www.homedepot.com/p/ARAUCO-9-16-in-x-5-1-4-in-x-8-ft-Radiata-Pine-Nickel-Gap-Ship-Lap-Board-1186659/300803794) to update a space because it’s a quick and easy way to bring depth to a room. I headed over to my local Home Depot to get my shiplap paneling and then cut it down to size to fit within my office cabinets. The great thing about your local Home Depot is that they can cut down your boards for you, if you don’t have the proper [saw](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RIDGID-15-Amp-Corded-12-in-Dual-Bevel-Sliding-Miter-Saw-with-70-Deg-Miter-Capacity-and-LED-Cut-Line-Indicator-R4222/306939244) to do so at home.

I secured the paneling to the wall by using two-inch [brad nails](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-2-in-x-18-Gauge-Metal-Brad-Nails-2500-per-Pack-DBN18200-2/205647387) and a [brad nailer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-20V-MAX-XR-Lithium-Ion-Electric-Cordless-18-Gauge-Brad-Nailer-Tool-Only-DCN680B/302029641). For extra strength, feel free to also use some paneling adhesive.

Once I installed the shiplap paneling, I went through with [wood filler](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DAP-Plastic-Wood-X-with-DryDex-5-5-oz-All-Purpose-Wood-Filler-00540/206667344) to fill all the nail holes and used [caulking](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DAP-Alex-Fast-Dry-10-1-oz-White-Acrylic-Latex-Plus-Silicone-Caulk-18425/100634323) to fill all the cracks at the top and bottom. Once all the nail holes were filled, I used a [primer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Zinsser-1-gal-B-I-N-Shellac-Based-White-Interior-Primer-and-Sealer-320991/100398381) to paint the paneling to prepare it for paint.

## Everyone Needs a Little Color

![Two phone screens that showcase the app capability to see the paint virtually.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/A2JKVVTpf4wxbxbtnNJhvg/X5YAMO2t7SPf9ULe18mGHA/Original%20file/AshleyBasnight-HandmadeHaven-FY24Q3BrandEvolution-Photo6.png)

Adding color is hands down my favorite way to update a space because it’s the cheapest way to make a space look totally different. I knew I wanted to go bold in here, so I decided to go moody.

If you are someone that struggles with picking paint colors, feel free to utilize The Home Depot App to visualize colors in your space before committing to a color.

I decided to choose this awesome green color called “[Classic Bronze](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-DYNASTY-5-gal-N310-7-Classic-Bronze-Satin-Enamel-Exterior-Stain-Blocking-Paint-Primer-965305/324779023)” and it really made my office cabinets pop. I utilized my [Graco X5 Sprayer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Graco-Magnum-Project-Painter-Plus-Stand-Airless-Paint-Sprayer-with-20-in-Extension-25-ft-Hose-and-TRU311-Tip-18F025/315953604) to spray the cabinets because it always gives me that nice finish I’m looking for.

## Jazz It up With Wallpaper

![A wall with wallpaper and two framed paintings.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/GcWjzN7krHCaVUgiA38vRg/iDyQhXNyJxomsez1wEj6uQ/Original%20file/AshleyBasnight-HandmadeHaven-FY24Q3BrandEvolution-Photo8.jpg)

Wallpaper is another fun way to really make a statement with your space. I personally love going bold when it comes to wallpaper. I had this fun idea to add wallpaper to the shelves of my office cabinets. The Home Depot has so many wallpaper options to choose from and they have a wallpaper calculator that helps you calculate just how much wallpaper you need.

After seeing the wallpaper close-up, I decided to add it to a blank wall instead of adding it to the shelves, so I was able to add the wall measurements to the wallpaper calculator and figure out just how much I needed for this project.

## Styling Your Space

Once you finish updating your space, it’s time to style it. I was able to grab some fun items to bring my office space to completion. This sleek [desk](https://www.homedepot.com/p/JAYDEN-CREATION-Zulma-Modern-White-64-in-3-Storage-Drawers-Writing-Desk-with-Polished-Paint-finished-Desktop-DKHN0066-1/315097677) was the perfect combo for these dark green walls and I was able to bring in some contrast with this nice purple rolling [office chair](https://www.homedepot.com/p/JAYDEN-CREATION-Lydia-24-5-in-Mid-Century-Modern-Purple-Velvet-Tufted-Hand-Curated-Task-Chair-CHM6030-PURPLE/314842444).

The space really tied in together with this multi-colored vintage inspired [rug](https://www.homedepot.com/p/LOLOI-II-Layla-Olive-Charcoal-7-ft-6-in-x-9-ft-6-in-Distressed-Oriental-Printed-Area-Rug-LAYLLAY-03OLCC7696/316422111) and I can’t forget to mention this amazing [chandelier](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RRTYO-Wilbourn-16-Light-Mid-Century-Modern-Brass-2-Tiers-Sputnik-Chandelier-with-Milky-White-Glass-Globe-81010000046988/326724420) I found, it really is a statement piece for my office space.

I was able to utilize three easy ways to bring my office space to life and The Home Depot helped me get it all done!
