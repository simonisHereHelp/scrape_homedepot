You live in your home every day, but as life changes, sometimes your needs do too. Your home may need to adjust to new circumstances, and that’s where flex spaces come in. A flex space can be a room that’s completely repurposed for your new needs, or it can be a room that functions for multiple purposes. This guide explores how to plan your flex areas, and it gives some inspiration for the types of spaces you may want in your home.

## Plan for Flexibility

When you want a flex room to be able to change functions easily, look for mobile furniture and small, lightweight pieces. Murphy beds and wheeled desks are some examples. Storage should be available and can be either built-in, in the form of portable containers or furniture that doubles as storage – think storage ottomans and baskets. Paint and décor should complement most colors so it’s easy to repurpose the room at any time.

Flex rooms that will be multifunctional can use shelves or screens to divide it into sections. Consider painting walls or using decor with colors that complement all sections of the room. This will help it look cohesive.

Your flex room can be a spare room in your home, or you may be inspired to build an area. The areas below staircases are a great option for adding space to your home. Next, let’s look at some ideas for flex spaces in your home.

## Home Office

A home office makes sense for anyone who owns a business or works from home. A dedicated flex space just needs to feel inspiring and comfortable. Keep it well lit, whether with several lamps or natural lighting, and decorate it for long-term sessions. This may be an area you paint colorfully, even if you plan to use it for other tasks, or you may want it neutral for more options. You’ll need a desk, shelving for binders or other filing systems, a comfortable desk chair and any other essentials for your work. To make it more flexible, consider furniture that is light enough to be easily moved.

## Homework Station

Whether you have children in grade school or college, or even if you’re in school yourself, having a dedicated area for homework is a great idea for a small flex space. You’ll need a desk of course, storage for paper and writing instruments, lighting for the desk space, and maybe even a bookshelf. The desk can be a foldout type if you’re tight on space or if you plan to use the room for other things. Homework stations can be tucked into a smaller section of a larger room for a multipurpose room as well. In that case, partitions may be useful to encourage focus.

## Supply Closet

![A supply closet with two open doors sits underneath a staircase.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/BhhVj7gnV-HS8BmOAUSoVg/kDlSuqvpwjC29kSsRNJc1g/Original%20file/how-to-create-a-flex-space-section-4-A.jpg)

Turn your small flex space into a closet for supplies or other things. Hooks and shelves attached to the walls will help keep things organized and maximize vertical space. You can also add storage containers like cube shelves or lightweight drawer sets. Cabinets and storage racks are also excellent additions. Make sure you have enough light so items can be seen easily when you need to access them.

## Pet Area

![A person watches a dog lying on a dog bed in a room built under the stairs.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/AV1mPDuCGUuaxcQZtKgT7w/eoevNslb8cHI4XSyX7N9sw/Original%20file/how-to-create-a-flex-space-section-5-A.jpg)

A dedicated pet area can make your home more organized and give your pet a much-needed space for their things. This small area can house your pet’s food and water stations. It could also be used for their sleeping and relaxation needs by including their bed, crate or vertical spaces, depending on the type of pet you have. In this case, you may want to have lighting that can be muted to be less stimulating. If the space is big enough, you can also store food, toys, carriers, leashes, collars and other pet-related items. For pets that need to be kept separated from the rest of the home when you leave for a few hours, a pet room may be a solution.

## Reading Nook

![A lounge chair and ottoman sit in the corner of a room with a full bookshelf and soft lighting.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/NZ7LLNlYoQkSouMIuRh3uQ/n1iy3xDPaeKI58SclbLNhQ/Original%20file/how-to-create-a-flex-space-section-6-A.jpg)

If you have a lot of books and you love to read, a reading nook could be a dream come true. Outfit this flex space with lots of shelves for your books. You might opt for wall shelving or standalone shelves. Built-in shelving would be a great investment also, even if you plan to use the room for other things. The lighting should be suitable for your reading needs. Some people prefer soft lighting, while others need bright lights. You may want a variety as your eyesight changes. Have a cozy seating area, whether you prefer a couch, daybed or lounge chair with an ottoman. The room can easily convert if any furniture you use is light enough to be moved easily.

## Beverage Station

![A coffee and tea station with a microwave and small refrigerator nearby.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/mjNNMrw1eTedHFLK1eZf8A/jvGUMO15T-kHUowfR4QFQg/Original%20file/how-to-create-a-flex-space-section-7-A.jpg)

A coffee or tea station is perfect for morning coffee, coffee breaks and tea time. This area could be cozy, with a lounge chair and lamp for enjoying your hot – or iced – beverage. It can also be a well-stocked station off to the side of a larger area. Include storage for filters, bags of coffee, loose and bagged tea selections and anything your household members like to add to their drinks. You may want to make it house a water dispenser or bottled water, or it could even be a minibar for adult beverages. Don’t forget to use lighting that sets whatever mood you want your beverage area to complement.

Flex spaces are a sensible use of extra space in your home. They can be dedicated or temporary, and the possibilities for their use are endless.
