## Table Lamps

![A table lamp sits on an end table next to a sofa.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/DpfSoN7vXpoNmNWpy9p74w/YXPgDaxwvopCF0_mR0loEw/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-1.jpg)

[Table lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Table-Lamps/N-5yc1vZc7pt)  
are designed to  
sit on top of other pieces of furniture, including end tables, dressers, vanities and shelves. Although many table lamps are versatile, the type of table lamp will usually determine its best location in your home. A table lampâ€™s purpose is usually more defined than that of a floor lamp.  


Below is a list of the common types of table lamps and their uses.  


## Bedside Lamps

![A lamp sits on a wooden bedside table next to a bed.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/bss8rLer5fZd61isx7wrOQ/4BL6fFrAcd8GB2MmuCUTAA/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-2.jpg)

Also known as end table lamps, [bedside lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Table-Lamps/Bedside/N-5yc1vZc7ptZ1z1c6rb) primarily serve as decorative accents and add low lighting. These lamps can be used in any room, not just the bedroom, and cast a soft, atmospheric glow.  


## Buffet Lamps

![Two buffet lamps sit on a white dresser. ](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/oPAP10SBvysX2Rc4RYwsCg/gNgDveV5wbf4vNKDV5mDSA/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-3.jpg)

[Buffet lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Table-Lamps/Buffet/N-5yc1vZc7ptZ1z1c6na) are traditionally placed on dining tables and sideboards to illuminate a dining room during a meal, but they can be placed  
anywhere that needs more focused light than what the usual bedside lamp offers. These lamps are long and slender and are often paired with a bell-shaped lamp shade to cast light downward.  


## Tripod Table Lamps

[Tripod lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Tripod/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6tg) are end table lamps with a three-leg construction. This style of lamp fits best with contemporary home decor.

## Candlestick Lamps

Often considered a kind of buffet lamp, [candlestick lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Candlestick/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c65u) are tall, thin lamps. The bases resemble candlesticks in holders. Candlestick lamps can serve as permanent alternatives to candle centerpieces on dining or serving tables, or they can be a great option as a space-saving living room lamp.

## Task Lamps

![An arc task lamp lights a white office desk.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/RK_KiWGQVIiNUwmoG_nNjA/Yq5VT65YN0rfecV6_ePpEQ/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-6.jpg)

Task lamps, or [desk lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Desk-Lamps/N-5yc1vZc7pp), are designed to provide targeted task lighting. They cast focused, downward light to illuminate workspaces and will often have adjustable bases or arms so that you can direct the light as needed.

## Banker Lamps

![A banker lamp sits on a desk in a home office.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/Q1KajNxF6HdYVJGasMmlrA/MmhsyLycua_eKyOeOQEI3A/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-7.jpg)

Also called piano lamps, [banker lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Desk-Lamps/Bankers/N-5yc1vZc7ppZ1z1c6h0) are known for their squat silhouettes and downward-facing, oblong shades. The height and position of banker lamps typically cannot be adjusted, but these lamps cast a wide range of light that is perfect for studying or writing at a desk.

## Swing-Arm Table Lamps

![A swing-arm table lamp sits on a white desk.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/OSOxjCLO_IHe1drRMefQwQ/Pm5SkIXGPV6rUMJ_OBJH-w/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-8.jpg)

[Swing-arm table lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Table-Lamps/Swing-Arm/N-5yc1vZc7ptZ1z1c6mx) have an extended arm that can be pivoted to adjust the position of the light. These lights are excellent on end tables and beside chairs and sofas for comfortable, well-lit reading.

## Gooseneck Desk Lamps

![A gooseneck desk lamp on a home office desk. ](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/zcewrr78i2Dno0bRGXttpw/ThoerJXqM1_0HUbbrRYXhQ/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-9.jpg)

[Gooseneck desk lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Desk-Lamps/Gooseneck/N-5yc1vZc7ppZ1z1c6iv) are task lamps with long, flexible necks. Most often found on work desks, these lamps are useful and versatile lights to have because their adjustable necks point light in any direction.

## Floor Lamps

![A floor lamp lights the corner of a living room.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/mRrBJE-0EO7xyDRBLbli7w/Nhb_Ke3JHVTPN4C9y0tbuQ/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-10.jpg)

[Floor lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Floor-Lamps/N-5yc1vZc7no) are freestanding and can be placed anywhere in a room so long as an electrical outlet is nearby, which makes them adaptable and a popular choice of lamp. A standard or traditional floor lamp will have a tall, straight pole that extends from a single base. They are usually paired with a cone- or bell-shaped lamp shade that casts gentle, downward light.

Below is a list of the common types of  
floor  
lamps and their uses.  


## Task Floor Lamps

![A task floor lamp extends over a small table. ](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/3nsE9OhwKyrrewM_8QATPQ/XuLNhjuRPHGnYTcM7SDZVA/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-11.jpg)

[Task floor lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Floor-Lamps/Task/N-5yc1vZc7noZ1z1c6ox) are  
similar to  
their table lamp counterparts but have the added benefit of being placed anywhere in a room without a desk or table. These floor lamps will typically have downward-casting [LED lights](/b/Lighting-Light-Bulbs-LED-Light-Bulbs/N-5yc1vZbm79) and a flexible, curved neck that you can adjust as needed.

## Arc Floor Lamps

![An arc floor lamp lights up a contemporary living room.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/kgmWPWC-tL96V0auBsUpHg/mHODc7qE_9YU9SjTWWznVQ/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-12.jpg)

[Arc floor lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Floor-Lamps/Arc/N-5yc1vZc7noZ1z1c6re) or arched floor lamps have a graceful curve that grants them an extended reach. They may have multiple curved arms with lights on each. Arc floor lamps are ideal for placing beside or behind chairs and sofas where you need extra illumination.

## Tripod Floor Lamps

![A tripod floor lamp sits behind a white armchair in a living room.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/debH5PW_hL_Em4qPvQZSFQ/J57oy8LFrLxyeYzxE8X2dQ/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-13.jpg)

[Tripod floor lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Floor-Lamps/Tripod/N-5yc1vZc7noZ1z1c6tg) are popular lamps for contemporary style homes, similar to tripod table lamps. Tripod floor lamps have three legs instead of a single base.  


## Tree Lamps

![A tree floor lamp with three branches sits next to a white armchair.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/ORQYulLdkma9mCoGRy6Ztw/bNqNGqoh5fdctAvPaQwVRA/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-14.jpg)

[Tree lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Floor-Lamps/Tree/N-5yc1vZc7noZ1z1c6hi) have several arms that extend and branch out from the base. Since they have multiple lights, tree lamps can brighten areas more than standard floor lamps and offer opportunities to get creative with your lighting by installing different colored bulbs. Choose these floor lamps when you need light but have limited space for a lamp.

## Swing-Arm Floor Lamps

![A swing-arm floor lamp illuminates a living room.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/rizhN20ohiJ5au_SLlO11w/2NlhT5DGyLBKZECX6okE0A/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-15.jpg)

Just like swing-arm table lamps, [swing-arm floor lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Floor-Lamps/Swing-Arm/N-5yc1vZc7noZ1z1c6mx) have a pivotable, extended arm so you can adjust the position of the light.

## Torchiere Lamps

![A torchiere lamp sits next to an entryway table. ](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/c3LWlQfJZBcT-Q1rRvGiOQ/RlBtpV0BMK-JAFnljybK2Q/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-16.jpg)

Like a torch, [torchiere lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Torchiere/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6p2) direct their light upward and outward to brighten a room. These floor lamps look  
similar to  
a standard floor lamp, but they have a lamp shade that flares upward rather than downward.

## Pharmacy Lamps

![A pharmacy lamp in black finish over a modern seating area. ](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/OwtPxhbsiZAeZY52FMTtkQ/5Zmk0plXPobo8L_5DkOd9w/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-17.jpg)

A [pharmacy lamp](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Pharmacy/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6p4) is a type of task lamp that has a rigid yet adjustable arm and a dome-shaped metal shade that directs a focused stream of light downward.

## Column Lamps

![A column lamp shines brightly next a black sofa and a brick wall. ](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/_U20_4TYAThH93vgVmUkpw/cFKgC0jtK4_D9gYiZV7wYg/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-18.jpg)

[Column lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Shelf-Column/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6qo) are unique floor lamps that are shaped like a tall and often rectangular tower or column. Column lamps stand out as an art piece and are made for those who want to make a statement with their lamps.

## Shelf Lamps

![Home decor sits on the shelves of a shelf lamp in a contemporary room.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/kpIslK4g6Rl2L0EeSJpTxg/Oagg5iCor0xML2O7InCpPw/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-19.jpg)

[Shelf lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Shelf-Column/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6qo) combine a lamp and shelf storage to create one functional, space-saving piece of furniture. These lamps are often a type of column lamp, but they can also have a tripod construction with shelves installed between the legs.

## Chandelier Lamps

![A chandelier lamp sits in front of a dark wall.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/BPnJcvdVrNiZhm-9lnH7fQ/e28pcjXXbnEku76skwQqDA/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-20.jpg)

These statement lamps are styled after hanging chandeliers and can have impressive hanging crystal pieces, multiple candelabra-style lights and extravagant designs. [Chandelier lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Chandelier/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6rn) are guaranteed to be eye-catching in the living room or elsewhere.

## Lamp Sets

![A living room lamp set consisting of two matching table lamps and one floor lamp.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/sAV9fBH2JCrDl-bi9xJoyQ/EG_OrhllA1Kml3vBE3qqvA/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-21.jpg)

If you are aiming to light a large room or multiple rooms, consider purchasing a [lamp set](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Lamp-Sets/N-5yc1vZc7o8). Lamp sets have at least two matching lamps that are designed to create a cohesive flow in your home. The lamps in the set can be different sizes or colors, alternate designs and any combination of table or floor lamps, but they will always coordinate well and make lighting an entire room easier.  


## Novelty Lamps

![A white elephant lamp sits on a dresser. ](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/SkCjqPtKt190T4VTrCCnKw/XcI4wU0ifjleUORpPrushA/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-22.jpg)

When choosing lighting for your living room and more rooms in your home, you are not limited to the above  
types  
of lamps. There many more distinctive types of lamps and unique variations of popular lamp styles. Some lamps defy easy categorization.  
  


Below are a few [novelty lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Novelty-Lamps/N-5yc1vZc7q1) that can brighten your home in unexpected ways:

[Lava Lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Novelty-Lamps/Lava-Lamp/N-5yc1vZc7q1Z1z1c6ya): For a fun retro vibe, incorporate a lava lamp into your home decor. A lava lampâ€™s colorful glow can add a soothing ambiance to your room.  


[Himalayan Salt Lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Novelty-Lamps/Himalayan-Salt-Lamp/N-5yc1vZc7q1Z1z1c6iu): Himalayan salt lamps will be both a natural-inspired centerpiece and a helpful tool to have in the winter. Their release of positive ions may help improve your mood.  


[Moon Lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Novelty-Lamps/Moon-Lamp/N-5yc1vZc7q1Z1z1cajn):  
Moon lamps are miniature replicas of the moon that are lit internally. A moon lamp is a mesmerizing decorative piece that you can leave on all night to serve as a night light.  


[Swag Lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Novelty-Lamps/Swag-Lamp/N-5yc1vZc7q1Z1z1carw):  
A swag lamp is somewhere between a ceiling light and a floor lamp, since it hangs from the ceiling but connects to a wall outlet with a decorative cord. A swag lamp can be hung from anywhere you choose, so long as its cord can reach an outlet.  


[Night  
Lights](/b/Lighting-Night-Lights/N-5yc1vZbmgy):  
Night lights are small lights that add a bit of light to an otherwise darkened room. They can soothe the roomâ€™s occupant as he or she falls asleep or light a path without creating a disturbing amount of light. Usually, night lights are small enough to be plugged directly into a wall outlet.  


## Lamp Materials

![An assortment of contemporary lamps on display in a living room.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/VHEVethCS-QU4adu8XOYYg/4TaNfpe0bcd2rxv3_Qe-Hg/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-23.jpg)

The materials of the lamp and lamp shade are two major factors in defining a lampâ€™s style. Popular lamp materials include wood, brass, ceramic, marble and glass â€“ although many other unique options are available as well.  


[Wood Lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Wood/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6gp): Wood lamps can be subtle and blend in with your existing furniture, or they can stand apart with a vintage or rustic finish. Extremely versatile, wood lamps are a reliable choice for any room in your home.  


[Brass Lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Brass/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6bm): Lamps made from brass can either maintain their warm finish or can have a silver or bronze coating. Depending on the shape and finish you choose, brass lamps can have a striking contemporary look or a refined vintage finish.  


[Ceramic Lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Ceramic/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6h4): Ceramic lamps are often handcrafted and painted, offering one-of-a-kind designs. These lamps are a great way to add a piece of functional art to your home.  


[Marble Lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Marble/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6c7): To create a powerful statement in a minimalist-style home, choose a marble lamp. Classic yet bold, marble lamps strike the right balance between simplicity and grandeur.  
  


[Glass Lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Glass/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6dm): If you are trying to make a space feel open and breezy, use a glass lamp. The glass can be tinted or clear, textured or smooth, and still create a feeling of more space, rather than adding to tabletop clutter.

Similarly, lamp shades come in a wide variety of materials, but the most popular lamp shade materials are parchment, silk, linen and laminated card.

## Lamp Features

![A desk lamp with a USB outlet that is connected to and charging a smartphone.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/2LNKPnyycovlTtsItSq85A/DH7PAM18rmHXvyIwksxeGw/Original%20file/types-of-lamps-for-the-living-room-and-more-section-24.jpg)

Any type of lamp can have additional features that will make them more functional in your home.

[Dimmable lamps](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Dimmable/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6fg) allow you to adjust the amount of light as needed. This feature can be especially useful for party lighting, watching movies, winding down in the evening or brightening the room for certain tasks.  


Some lamps may be [smart enabled](/b/Lighting-Lamps/Smart-Lighting/N-5yc1vZc7pdZ1z1c6iw) so you can control them from your smart phone or other electronic devices, while other lamps may turn on and off with just a touch of your hand.

Smaller task lights may not even require an electrical outlet and can instead be powered and charged through your computerâ€™s USB port. Alternatively, many modern desk lights also have USB ports for charging other devices.

Lamps help create the mood and aesthetic in your home. It's worth shopping around to find ones that truly compliment your home. Lamps are incredibly versatile and varied, so be sure to explore all the types of lamps available to you through The Home Depot to find the perfect one for your home.
