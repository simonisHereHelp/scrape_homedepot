## Create Your Vision

Making over a room can feel like a big project, but breaking it down into simple steps can help to make even the biggest of transformations feel like a breeze, especially with the help of The Home Depot.

First start your room makeover journey by crafting a vision board. Take a moment to analyze the current state of your room and think about the colors, designs, and overall aesthetic that you desire for your space.

For me, creating a moodboard outlining the direction I wanted my room transformation to go in was the key in my success on this project.

## Prep + Painting

Preparation is key to a successful room makeover. Begin by protecting your floors with plastic tarps to guard against any accidental paint spills. Then, choose a color that resonates with your vision.

I opted for [Glidden’s Veil of Dusk](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Glidden-Premium-1-gal-PPG1029-2-Veil-Of-Dusk-Flat-Interior-Latex-Paint-PPG1029-2P-01F/310145521), a hue with khaki and green/yellow undertones, and it was perfect for complementing my earthy theme.

Once prepped, paint your walls to set the foundation for your makeover.

## Calculating Measurements + Making Cuts

Measure twice, cut once! When planning your [box trim](https://www.homedepot.com/p/American-Pro-Decor-1-3-8-in-x-7-16-in-x-96-in-Plain-Recycled-Polystyrene-Panel-Moulding-Pro-Pack-128-LF-16-Pack-5APD10725/207038931) designs, precision is key. Begin by measuring the length of each wall and calculating the dimensions for your box trim.

Consider factors like spacing and preferred height for each box trim element. For instance, I aimed for a 5-inch spacing gap from walls and baseboards, with a desired lower box trim height of 20 inches.

Using these preferences, I calculated the height of the upper box trim by subtracting the total spacing gaps from the ceiling height, minus the height of the lower box trim. This gave me a height of 68 inches for each piece. To calculate the width, subtract the total wall width from the number of spacing gaps, then divide by the desired number of box trim designs.

For example, on my 98-inch-wide wall, I wanted two box trim designs. So, subtracting 15 inches for gaps, I divided the remaining 83 inches by two, resulting in 41.5 inches for each box trim width. Apply these width calculations consistently across all walls for uniformity.

## Installing the Box Trim Design

With your measurements and cuts ready, it's time to install the box trim. I began by using a 5" spacer block and leveler to ensure even spacing and alignment. I then secured each piece to the wall using my [Makita 18-Gauge Cordless Brad Nailer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Makita-18V-LXT-Lithium-Ion-18-Gauge-Cordless-Brad-Nailer-Tool-Only-XNB01Z/206278269) and 1.75" brad nails. Work your way up from the bottom panel, using your spacer, level and brad nail gun throughout the entirety. Take your time to ensure each piece is perfectly positioned and leveled before nailing each piece!

## Adding the Final Touches

With the box trim accent wall in place, it's time to add the finishing touches that will bring your vision to life. Handpick decor items that complement your chosen color scheme and style. From moss green velvet curtains to a mid-century modern side table, each piece should enhance the overall aesthetic of the room. Consider adding elements like this jute area rug, artificial olive tree, end-of-bed bench, and textured lamp to create an inviting and cohesive space.

## The Final Reveal
