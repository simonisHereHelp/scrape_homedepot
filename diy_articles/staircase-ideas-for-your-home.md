Stairs can be more than just a way to connect floors in your home. They can be simply practical, with no flourishes or decorations. On the other hand, some staircase designs are works of art. Most homes have something in between. If you’re planning to spruce up your stairs, this guide offers staircase remodel ideas and staircase design inspiration.

## Staircases 101

Before discussing staircase ideas, it’s useful to understand the general staircase structure and the [stair parts](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Building-Materials-Moulding-Millwork-Stair-Parts/N-5yc1vZbcro).

  * Stringer: This long board frames and supports the staircase. There are two stringers, each running the length of the stairs on each side. The wall stringer is secured to the wall, and the other one is called the outer stringer. The stringer may also be hidden by a skirtboard for decoration. Floating stairs may not have stringers at all.

  * Treads: These are the part of the stairs that you step on.

  * Risers: When you’re walking up your staircase, and your toe hits a vertical board, this board is called a riser. It’s a vertical piece that’s between each tread. Risers aren’t included for floating staircases, so that vertical space is left empty.

  * Handrail/Banister: You hold on to this part of the stairs. Sometimes there is one handrail, and sometimes there are handrails on both sides of the stairs.

  * Newel posts: These are vertical pieces at the bottom and the top of a staircase. The handrail is attached to the posts.

  * Baluster: Most stairs have vertical spindles or thin pieces that run the length of the stairs between the newel posts. They add stability and also work to keep bigger items from falling off the stairs on the sides. The handrail is also attached to balusters.




Note: Make sure you understand the local building codes before starting any staircase remodel or new installation.

## Staircase Design Ideas

Staircases come in a variety of styles. Each shape takes up differing amounts of horizontal space. Shape also affects how easy or difficult it is to use the stairs.

  * Modular: Modular staircases are pre-made stairs that make installation more straightforward. They can be any shape.

  * Spiral: These staircases have a pole in the center, and the stairs spiral around it. There are often kits that include pre-made, modular spiral staircases to make building them easier.

  * Other stair shapes: Stairs can also come in other shapes, whether they’re modular or built from scratch. Some of the shapes include, straight, L-shaped, U-shaped, winder and curved.




## Modern Staircases

The classic or traditional staircase design is usually associated with wood and intricate details. The wood, [handrails](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Building-Materials-Moulding-Millwork-Stair-Parts-Stair-Railings-Handrails/N-5yc1vZ2fkpaac) and balusters are often highly decorated. Traditional staircases also tend to have curves as opposed to straight lines, runners instead of bare stairs, and well-designed newel posts at the lower and upper ends.

Modern staircases tend to include glass or metal materials in their design, and they often feature straight lines throughout. They focus on simplicity instead of elaborate design elements. Design elements that exist are usually more innovative, often being both decorative and useful. Space is also maximized physically and aesthetically. Modern staircases generally take up a small amount of physical space, but they’re designed to appear open and airy.

When looking for modern staircase ideas, look for elements like floating stairs, metal spindles and built-in lighting.
