## Prep a Room for Painting

![Paint and related tools and equipment spread out on floor.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/yKXS0TCE8c7aUa-4Gv2uUg/_y_6bIisE_oR9alP30ZYMQ/Original%20file/how-to-paint-a-room-step-1.jpg)

Prep work is the first and most important step when painting a room. Follow these steps below when preparing a room for interior house painting. You should know that these steps apply whether you’re painting on your own or using a paint sprayer.:

  * Remove all furniture and fixtures, including lights, blinds, HVAC registers and outlet covers.
  * Carefully inspect surfaces for cracks, holes, dents or other imperfections.
  * Use a putty knife and lightweight [spackling compound](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Patching-Repair-Spackle/N-5yc1vZ2fkpczs) to fill and repair holes and cover imperfections.
  * Remove excess spackling with the [putty knife.](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Tools-Putty-Knives/N-5yc1vZci2c) Allow to dry following manufacturer's instructions before painting.
  * Use a small piece of fine [220-grit sandpaper](/b/Building-Materials-Drywall-Drywall-Tools-Drywall-Sanding-Tools-Drywall-Sand-Paper/N-5yc1vZ2fkpcxw) or a sanding sponge to smooth the repaired areas flush with the surface. Some surfaces might require a specific sandpaper. Be sure to read the manufacturer's guidelines before sanding.
  * Wipe surfaces clean with a damp towel or sponge and let dry. A heavy-duty cleaner may help to remove dirt and grease from the walls and trim. Be sure to keep rags, buckets, water and paint sticks nearby for mixing. These will also come in handy for cleanup and mixing afterward.
  * Wear old clothes and a hat while painting.
  * Make sure you have rubber gloves and eye protection on hand.
  * Whenever you start any interior house painting project, always work in a properly ventilated space. You must open all windows and doors. You should also use fans and proper safety gear, like a [respirator mask](/b/Safety-Equipment-Respirator-Masks/N-5yc1vZc25k) and ventilator. This keeps the area safe and free of paint particles, especially with strong fumes.



Safety Tip: When painting interior walls, make sure to follow EPA guidelines if the existing paint contains lead.

## Plan It Out

![Ladder, paint and other materials on drop cloth in empty room.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/0n6qKHBvGcoXzK6NtLvZ-w/4xEx8qHRfIq7XmTSrfIU6Q/Original%20file/how-to-paint-a-room-step-2.jpg)

You can start anywhere when you paint a room. However, using an orderly process can save time and effort. Painting a room in the correct order will also reduce drips and runs. A good rule of thumb is to always start with the ceiling. Next, paint the walls and end by painting baseboards, windows and door trim.

Tip: Maintain efficiency by getting enough paint. A gallon of paint can roughly cover between 250 and 300 square feet of wall space. Determine exactly how much you need with our [paint project calculator](https://secure2.homedepot.com/account/view/calculator/paint).   


## Apply Painter’s Tape for Painting

![Someone applying blue painter's tape to prep a space.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/IULvv8Px39SFBa2h5ReM4g/w16hA5cpVKpHm6_muAWpuA/Original%20file/how-to-paint-a-room-step-3.jpg)

The next step in prepping and painting interior walls is to use apply painter's tape. It is used to mask off trim, baseboards, windows, doors, doorknobs, power outlets and other fixtures. You should also remove the hardware from furniture.

  * Press [painter's tape](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Tape-Painters-Tape/N-5yc1vZcibu) firmly in place to prevent paint from seeping underneath or bleeding through.
  * For non-textured surfaces, apply painter's tape at the edge of the wall. Place painter’s tape in short, overlapping strips for more control and best coverage.
  * If you have a textured ceiling and are painting only the walls, run a screwdriver along the ceiling's edge. This creates a small, unnoticeable, texture-free surface for the painter's tape to adhere to. It is then easier to create a straight paint edge.
  * If you're painting an accent wall, mask off the inside edge of the wall from the rest of the room.



Choose the right painter's tape or masking tape adhesion level for the job. Some are perfect for textured surfaces. But others are intended for more delicate areas, like a freshly painted wall, finished hardwood or wallpaper.

## Spread Drop Cloths When Painting a Room

![A man and woman lay down a drop cloth in a room.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/M2-jG6yrPulpVbzXBL_7OQ/M_Krf_VlVAZ5Jso1GYIfvA/Original%20file/how-to-paint-a-room-step-4.jpg)

Cover the floors, furniture, fixtures and any other areas with drop cloths or a tarp to protect them from paint drips, spray and splatters. Move furniture out of the room or move it to the center. Then, cover it with drop cloths.

  * Canvas drop cloths are both durable and absorbent. They can also be reused.
  * Plastic drop cloths are durable and budget-friendly but not absorbent. Spills are more likely to be tracked if stepped on.
  * Paper is the most economical type of drop cloth but can tear easily when laid out on floors. Paper is better for covering light fixtures, cabinets and furniture.



## How to Prime Walls for Painting

![Woman applying white primer on a wall with a roller.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/byKto8uGLt7HYodhtMjB4A/x9YRqyIpUFvK5DaU-Tr1Cw/Original%20file/how-to-paint-a-room-step-5.jpg)

Apply primer before painting walls. Primers are designed to help seal the wall and prevent mold. A primer is essential if you are changing from dark paint color to a lighter one. Some primers can be tinted to match the color of the paint. Primer is more budget-friendly than paint. So, a tinted primer can provide coverage at a lower cost, saving you money on paint. Many brands also offer paint and primer in one.  


  * Begin by using a high-quality [paint brush](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Brushes/N-5yc1vZarac) to brush paint 2-3 inches along the edge of the wall, windows and corners of a room. This process is known as "cutting in."
  * For best results, work in one small area at a time.
  * You may want to follow the process of "edging painting." This involves cutting in the wall's edges before painting rolling or painting the entire wall. Doing so prevents the borders from drying before you finish painting the wall. It also keeps the sheen uniform. If edging, use an angled brush to apply a thick coat.



Next, start painting primer onto the wall in 3-by-3-foot sections.  


  * Choose the right roller cover for your wall surface and place it onto your [paint roller](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Rollers/N-5yc1vZaqpy). For smooth ceilings, use a low nap roller. For a textured ceiling, use a thicker roller, with a 1/2-inch or 3/4-inch nap.
  * Pour primer into a paint tray.
  * Dip the roller into the paint, making sure it’s completely covered.
  * Roll the paint roller over the ridged area of the [paint tray](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Trays-and-Liners/N-5yc1vZaqcd) a few times to remove excess paint.
  * With a fully loaded paint roller, work top to bottom. Roll it back and forth across the wall in a series of V- or W-shaped strokes.
  * Roll in one section at a time, moving from top to bottom and from one side of the wall to the other. The goal is to achieve even coverage, with no drips. Press lightly on the roller to prevent drips and lines.
  * Reload the roller and paint the next section. Cover only as much as you can finish while the primer is still wet. Overlap areas of wet primer only.



Tip: Do not try to get opaque coverage. If the wall still shows through, you may have to apply a second coat of primer to the wall before painting with your paint color.  


## Sand the Primer Before Painting the Room

Once the primer dries, lightly sand bumps and ridges using fine grit sandpaper folded into quarters.

  * When the grit of one section of sandpaper becomes covered with dust, switch to an unused section and continue.
  * Wipe the wall clean with a damp towel or sponge and let it dry.
  * Follow the manufacturer's instructions for adding additional coats of paint to the wall. Blend sections as you work.



## Paint the Walls

Paint walls one at a time. Blend the wet paint you’ve brushed on with wet paint you’re rolling. Also known as “working to a wet edge," this is one of the best painting tips and techniques for walls.  


  * Working from top to bottom, roll the paint roller back and forth across the wall in a series of V- or W-shaped strokes. Do this until the section is covered.
  * Before reloading your roller and moving to the next section, roll over the area you’ve just painted. Use a smooth, continuous stroke, going from top to bottom. These smoothing strokes even the coat, catch any drips and help to cover up lines and tracks.
  * Overlap areas already painted. Lightly lift the roller off the wall to avoid leaving end marks. This also lets you seamlessly blend different areas.
  * Frequently remix paint, using a mixing stick or a paint mixing tool. Do this any time you leave your paint sitting for an extended period of time.
  * Wait 2-4 hours for the first coat to dry before applying a second coat.
  * Follow the same process and techniques used when priming walls, blending sections as you work.
  * To prevent paint from drying on the roller, store your paint roller in a plastic bag between coats. This will keep the paint and brush moist between uses.
  * Keep your paint color uniform. Once you’ve used half a gallon of paint, refill that can with paint from a different can and mix together. If you’re doing a large job, mix several gallons into one 5-gallon bucket.



Tip: If you have a large area to paint, consider using a paint sprayer to apply paint quickly and evenly.  


## Wrap Up & Clean

When you have completed painting, clean and remove paint on floors and other surfaces. Take time to clean your tools, so they're ready for your next painting job.

  * Remove painter’s tape right before or right after paint dries completely. If left on too long, small pieces of tape will tear and leave residue when being removed.
  * Use a painter's knife to slice through any painter's tape that is stuck. You might also have to use paint thinner to remove stubborn paint drips.
  * Apply a small amount to a cloth and gently rub over the drip. Take care not to rub too hard or it might remove paint on the floor or wall, along with the drip.
  * Tightly seal remaining paint in cans.
  * Clean paint brushes and rollers with warm soapy water.
  * Remove drop cloths and move furniture back into place.



## Renting a Paint Sprayer

![A man showing The Home Depot representative his rental order on his cell phone.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/2QgjrK8CDXCD4kl7V7Wvpw/GmFgzf115TFtXpKivCo3KA/Original%20file/how-to-paint-a-room-step-9.jpg)

Many people prefer to rent a paint sprayer from The Home Depot when taking on new projects. This is a good option if you’re short on time or physically unable to paint. With a paint sprayer, you can cover large areas faster. You’re also able to quickly complete smaller painting jobs, like tables or chairs.

  * Choose a medium-duty paint sprayer for projects requiring 15 gallons or less, like small rooms, furniture and outdoor spaces. The most versatile model, it's lightweight and easy to maneuver. It also doesn’t require an air compressor.
  * For projects requiring over 15 gallons, choose a Pro paint sprayer. It has a much larger capacity but keeps the smaller version’s same ease-of-use and maneuverability.



## Using a Paint Sprayer

Here are some helpful tips for optimal paint sprayer performance:

  * When picking a paint, it should flow smoothly through the sprayer. Airless paint sprayer rentals use oil-based paints. They’re better than latex or water-based paints, which can be thicker and clog machines.
  * Have all necessary painting tools and equipment ready before starting a project. Besides the normal materials, you may need special items. For instance, a fiberglass twin stepladder or scaffold set may help for higher walls and ceilings. If you have to paint large, open indoor areas, such as warehouses, The Home Depot has scissor lifts for rent that can rise up to 40 feet.
  * Be sure to follow the sprayer’s operations manual for all steps. Practice first, using a piece of scrap drywall or cardboard. This will allow you to use the sprayer correctly, using a smooth, back-and-forth motion. You can also figure out the distance needed for proper coverage.
  * Always begin your stroke movement before using the trigger to release paint. Then, end the stroke after releasing the trigger. Doing this prevents paint from building up on the surface. Regularly wiping your paint sprayer nozzle with a rag prevents clogging.
  * When using a sprayer, first paint corners and complex areas. You can then move on to flat surfaces, working top to bottom.
  * Once your project is completed, let the paint dry for 24-48 hours. Next, remove the painter’s tape and drop cloths. You can then move your furniture back into the room and continue designing.
  * Make sure you return your paint sprayer rental clean. When finished, clean the entire paint sprayer, as per the operations manual. If work remains, pour the leftover paint back into the can and clean the machine before storing.



Tip: Do not store paint in the paint sprayer for any extended period.
