We all have that one project that we’ve been meaning to work on, for me that project is renovating my outdated dining room.

With tools and materials found at The Home Depot, I was able to completely change the look and feel of my dining room in a matter of days. Once a dark and gloomy space is now bright and inviting.

The first step to renovating the room was using [Behr Paint & Primer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-PREMIUM-PLUS-1-gal-Ultra-Pure-White-Semi-Gloss-Enamel-Low-Odor-Interior-Paint-Primer-305001/202761530) to cover the old brown walls with a fresh coat of white paint which I found through The Home Depot’s large selection of Behr Paint colors and hues. It looked amazing with a fresh coat of paint that I could’ve stopped there but of course I wanted to do a complete renovation!

The next part may seem challenging to beginner DIY’ers but The Home Depot’s [LifeProof LVP](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Lifeproof-Vesinet-Oak-22-MIL-x-8-7-in-W-x-48-in-L-Waterproof-Click-Lock-Luxury-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring-561-7-sqft-pallet-3007101702/326697149) and its [kit](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Lifeproof-Pro-Flooring-Installation-Kit-for-Hardwood-Laminate-and-Vinyl-LP2218/318946562) made reflooring an effortless experience. To figure out how many cases of LVP I needed, I used The Home Depot’s [Project Calculator](https://www.homedepot.com/c/project_calculators) by entering the dimensions of my dining room.

Then I headed to my local store and used the The Home Depot App’s Product Locator feature, I was quickly able to find the LVP I needed. I was able to refloor the 200 square foot room in a matter of hours.

Once the walls and flooring were completed, I was able to update the lighting with a modern [pendant light](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-1-Light-Black-Warehouse-Pendant-Hanging-Light-with-Metal-Shade-AF-1032R-BK/313213138) from Hampton Bay. If you’re uncomfortable with the idea of tinkering with the electrical components of lighting, I’d definitely recommend hiring a professional.

Finally, to tie the room together I wanted to build a custom plywood table with prefinished [birch plywood](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Columbia-Forest-Products-3-4-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-PureBond-Birch-Plywood-165921/100077837) that I found at The Home Depot. Since I didn’t want to risk damaging my car, I ended up renting a flatbed truck from The Home Depot’s Rental department which I was able to reserve using the app. Using several of my favorite DeWalt power tools, the [circular saw](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-15-Amp-Corded-7-1-4-in-Lightweight-Circular-Saw-DWE575/203273038), [jigsaw](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-6-5-Amp-Corded-Variable-Speed-Jig-Saw-Kit-with-Kit-Box-DW331K/100618995), [orbital sander](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-3-Amp-Corded-5-in-Variable-Speed-Random-Orbital-Sander-DWE6423/311528803) and [power drill](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DEWALT-20V-MAX-Cordless-1-2-in-Drill-Driver-2-20V-1-3Ah-Batteries-Charger-and-Bag-DCD771C2/204279858), I was able to bring my concept to life within a day.

Over the course of a weekend, I was able to completely flip the dining room and turn it into one of my favorite spaces in my home.
