Choosing A Couch or Sofa



## Couch Vs. Sofa

![Dual image with black couch on left and gray sofa on right.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/qEpHv1gP5bwpRiFMGfOQiQ/5pdHa0-kyv_F2X_JO688ig/Original%20file/types-of-couches-and-sofas-section-1.jpg)

Today, "couch" and "sofa" usually refer to the same items. However, the term “couch” may mean a more casual, small, comfortable, armless piece. Meanwhile, “sofa” may convey a larger, less comfortable, more formal or antique piece used for sitting or hosting guests.

## Couch and Sofa Sizes

Once you start shopping, you must determine the proper couch sizes. Take measurements of both the couch’s size and its intended room. Look for types of sofas that roughly fit these measurements, if not slightly smaller. This will ensure you leave yourself enough room to easily move around the new couch.

  * A three-seat sofa: These allow three individuals to comfortably sit side by side. Typically, they measure between 72 inches and 96 inches, with 84 inches being the average.
  * Longer or bigger sofas: Taller people may prefer these pieces, measuring 87 inches to 100 inches or more in length.
  * Smaller sofas: Also called “apartment sofas,” they have less depth and length, which is great for smaller spaces.
  * Loveseats: Designed for two people, they measure between 48 inches and 72 inches, typically averaging about 52 inches to 66 inches. You may want to pair a loveseat with a couch, arranging them in an L-shaped configuration in your living room. Manufacturers typically classify loveseat dimensions like larger sofas.



Here are helpful measurement terms for your search.

  * Sofa depth: This measures the piece front to back. Most types of couches run 32 inches to 40 inches in depth, with 35 inches being the average.
  * Sofa height: This measures the distance from the couch top to the floor, usually 26 inches to 36 inches. It determines if your feet will rest on the ground.
  * Seat height: This measures the distance from the top of a couch’s seat cushion to the floor. It usually runs 15 inches to 20 inches, averaging 17 to 18 inches.
  * Seat depth: This measures the seat’s front to either its back edge or the sofa back. As this can affect posture, people of average height may prefer standard seat depths of 21 inches or 22 inches. Deep-seat sofas, with depths of 28 inches to 35 inches or more, are also available.



## Types of Couches and Sofas

When choosing from among the diverse types of sofas, some research may be needed. There are many models to consider, ranging from fancy, formal antiques to comfortable, laid-back favorites. A standard sofa or couch should comfortably seat 3 to 4 people.

## Types of Couch Fabrics and Materials

![Mother sitting on cream-colored fabric couch with children on floor.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/So4s6bE3CnEutcEDGVnfPQ/bQBbBiEcekSWKIHySmDTKg/Original%20file/types-of-couches-and-sofas-section-5.jpg)

When sofa shopping, you need to consider construction. The materials used should mesh with your home’s look and style. Materials can also determine such matters as the piece’s comfort, function, longevity and ease of cleaning. Less durable fabrics may be more susceptible to stretching and staining. Compared to looser weaves, tighter fabric weaves are also less prone to snags and more water-repellant.

One way manufacturers measure durability is a rub-count rating. A machine rubs back and forth until the material wears down, resulting in a numerical rating. A count of 100,000 is considered “high-performance,” while 80,000 is “premium.” A 50,000 count is “standard,” and ideal for high-traffic households. Anything above 25,000 is designated “fine.”

Look for these fabrics and materials in your search:

  * Velvet: Luxury fabric. Offers softness and durability.
  * Suede: A stylish, comfortable and durable fabric. Cleaning requires more effort.
  * Leather: Popular, sophisticated and long-lasting. Available in many colors and textures. [Leather sofas and couches](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-Sofas-Couches/Leather/N-5yc1vZc7oyZ1z0jjgr) are easily cleaned, with stain-resistant finishes. Consider vinyl, a synthetic, more durable and cost-effective alternative.
  * Twill: A tightly woven cotton fabric. Soft, casual and durable. Easily cleaned.
  * Boucle: A looped yarn fabric. Soft, nubby texture. Stylish, casual and fun. Easily maintained.
  * Textured weave: Soft and nubby like boucle, but chunkier and stronger. Offers an attractive, natural feel. Works well in busy homes.
  * Linen: Provides a soft texture cool to the touch. Simple clean-up.
  * Cotton: Good, breezy linen alternative. Can be treated and resist stains.
  * Denim: A durable cotton alternative. Absorbs stains and colors faster. Resists pilling, the breakdown of fabric fibers, which causes small fuzzballs.
  * Canvas: Another durable cotton alternative. Offers a more casual and relaxed style.
  * Chenille: Has a soft, silky and plush feel, like velvet. Durable, unless exposed to direct sunlight, so place sofas away from windows.
  * Wool and wool blends: Durable, with little wrinkling or piling. Easily spot-cleaned or vacuumed. Recommended for homes with children. Good heat retention.
  * Acrylic: A synthetic wool. Resists wear and tear, fading, wrinkling and discoloration.
  * Polyester: A non-allergenic, synthetic fiber that looks and feels like leather. [Polyester sofas and couches](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-Sofas-Couches/Polyester/N-5yc1vZc7oyZ1z0jjjl) can resist stains and damage more than some natural materials. Alternatives include nylon and olefin, which resist stains and damage.



## Choosing A Couch or Sofa

You can simplify and organize your sofa search by following these guidelines:

  * Take accurate measurements of your available space, including where the couch will sit, and the entire room.
  * As these are the maximum dimensions, consider a smaller sofa to ensure space for flow and ease of movement.
  * Keep in mind any nearby windows, rugs or furniture, like [accent tables](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-Accent-Tables/N-5yc1vZc7nz) or [coffee tables](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-Coffee-Tables/N-5yc1vZcf8z). Electronics and related pieces, like [TV stands](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-TV-Stands/N-5yc1vZcfct), may also need to be moved.
  * Consider the ideal number of seats for your household members and all sizing dimensions.
  * Research common styles and types of sofas to meet your needs and preferences. Before shopping in a physical location, check if a model is available.
  * Determine the couch’s functions and uses, such as a formal complement or a place for relaxation.
  * Consider sofa materials and fabrics, for both the interior and exterior. Think about concerns like comfort, texture, function, durability and cleaning.



Selecting the perfect couch is an ideal way to furnish and decorate your home. Take time to consider various models, along with such matters as the couch’s use, size, materials and your budget.
