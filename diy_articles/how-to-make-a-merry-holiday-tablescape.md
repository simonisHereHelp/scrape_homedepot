## Prep and Create DIY Napkins

Before you begin the DIY portion of the tablescape, gather your supplies and set them nearby. Having everything handy will help streamline setting the table. For the napkin rings you'll need burlap, scissors and cloth napkins.  


Adding a DIY touch, like burlap napkin rings, to your tablescape can up the warm and welcoming vibes.  
Bonus points for coordinating the colors of the napkin and the burlap.

Here's how:

  * Fold napkin into a neat rectangle.
  * Cut out a rectangular piece of burlap that’s slightly larger than the folded napkin. Cut out a long strip about the length of a shoelace.
  * Place the folded napkin on top of the piece of burlap.
  * Tie both fabrics together with the strip of burlap, wrapping the string like you would around a present, and place the final bundle on top of the plates.



Here's everything else you'll need to make this merry tablescape:  


  * Dinnerware
  * Glassware
  * Serving dish
  * Serving bowl
  * Candles
  * Placemats
  * Runner
  * Seasonal centerpiece
  * Garland
  * Utensils
  * Serving utensils
  * Matches or lighter



## Lay the Foundation

  * Clear the table, setting aside your napkins and napkin rings.
  * Lay down a runner. This look calls for a runner in a natural fiber. It's the perfect backdrop for any look, including this rustic scene.
  * If any lumps form in the runner, try to smooth it out and let it settle; however, the centerpiece and garland will hide any imperfections.



## Add Plates

  * It's time to add color to your natural tone foundation. We chose plates in a cool blue for a bit of a fresh winter style, but plates in any shade (think greens or even a winter white) can work with this neutral background.
  * At the center of the setting, lay down a placemat and put a dinner plate on top of it. If using, stack a salad plate on top of the dinner plate.



## Set Up Each Place Setting 

![Four place settings with plates, silverware and napkins.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-create-a-merry-holiday-tablescape-step-4.jpg)

  * Place a glass down at the upper right of the plates.
  * Arrange the utensils in this order from the left: the salad fork and the dinner fork to the left of the plates; the knife and the spoon to the right of them.
  * Repeat steps 1 through 4 for every seat at the table.



## Bring in the Centerpiece

  * Now, it's time to set the centerpiece in the center of the table. Use a simple but classic piece of garland to bring a bit of the outdoors in.
  * Snake the garland around the base of the centerpiece and carefully arrange any excess.



## Add Extra Details and Enjoy

The beauty of this tablescape is the mixture of elements and textures. Add extra details like candles in metallic tones to bring in appeal.  


  * Arrange the candles around the centerpiece and amid the garland. Light them when everyone is ready to be seated.
  * Eat, drink and be merry!
