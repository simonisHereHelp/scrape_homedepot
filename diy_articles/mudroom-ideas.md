## What is a Mudroom? 

![A young girl takes off her boots in an entryway mudroom.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/ph2r0qeXMqi7tjsizHC8_Q/12bh25BpLUgv2o-SS33Auw/Original%20file/mudroom-ideas-section-1_07-30-2024.jpg)

What is a mudroom in your home? As the name suggests, it is an entryway where the wet clothes and mud-covered shoes come off.  


Today’s mudroom is more than a place for an [umbrella stand](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Furniture-Entryway-Furniture-Umbrella-Stands/N-5yc1vZcfai). It is extra space for storage when the closets and garage fill. With some creativity and imagination, a mudroom renovation can reflect the overall decor of your home and leave an impression on your guests.  
  


## Mudroom Organization Ideas

The look of your mudroom can reflect your home’s unique style, but it must also be practical. Organization is essential in an area of your house where clothing and even unopened mail can accumulate. Here are some tips to consider when updating your entryway:

  * Create sufficient shelving that puts bags and carry items out of the way yet keeps them accessible.
  * Install locker-style storage areas to create individualized spaces for supplies, equipment and outerwear.
  * A shoe station for wet or mud-caked footwear is highly functional for a mudroom.



## Front Entrance Mudroom Ideas

A mudroom at the front of the house needs to look great whether it's full or empty. The perfect solution is a beautiful [hall tree](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Furniture-Entryway-Furniture-Hall-Trees/N-5yc1vZcf90/Ntk-elasticplus/Ntt-hall+tree) that includes doors and cubbies filled with baskets. Or if your front entry is cramped, choose a stylish [coat rack](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Furniture-Entryway-Furniture-Coat-Racks/N-5yc1vZcf8u). Pair your coat rack with these storage superstars:

  * Wall-mounted storage hooks are a space-saving option to hang things.
  * Wall-mounted [shelving](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Shelving/N-5yc1vZc89k) is suitable for storing bags and boxes and for decorative displays that attract the attention of visitors.



## Mudroom Ideas for Garages

Most people enter their homes either through the front door or through the garage entrance. A garage mudroom offers a bit more space to move around than in an attached mudroom. Creating a mudroom within a garage is also popular as a DIY project. Get creative with your garage storage ideas:

  * Go with a matching set of [garage storage](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Garage-Storage/N-5yc1vZarmi) shelving, track systems and cabinet systems in the corner of your garage.
  * Use a few plastic [storage containers](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Storage-Containers/N-5yc1vZcfzi) of different colors and sizes to hold coats and bags.
  * Lay down large [area rugs](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Rugs-Area-Rugs/N-5yc1vZarjg) to keep the dirt out of your house. Install cabinet shelving for work clothes, tools and other items you use for your yard work.



## Laundry Room Mudroom Ideas

The laundry room has great potential as a mudroom. The presence of a washer and dryer can limit the space. However, with some creativity and imagination, you can convert this utility space into a comfortable, functional transition area.

  * A small hall tree can store your coats and shoes without taking away the space for your detergent and clothes hampers.
  * Add vertical shelving and [cube storage](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Cube-Storage/N-5yc1vZcfzj) to take advantage of narrow entry space.
  * Try cabinetry for larger laundry room spaces. Wood cabinets are functional in the mudroom and can add to the overall decor.



## Mudroom Flooring Ideas

![Dramatic tile flooring installed in a narrow mudroom.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/_D4FiNMvPYFBcZEdup_x6w/Wqv2zTTNTD7vTzKUkrw2uA/Original%20file/mudroom-ideas-section-6_07-30-2024.jpg)

The flooring in your mudroom should withstand water, dirt and excess debris and be easy to clean. Durability and visual appeal are important factors to consider when choosing the best flooring type for your mudroom. There are a variety of tile and vinyl options that complement your existing interior themes while offering the strength and moisture-resistance you need.  


Tip: Consider adding a rug with a slip-proof backing for extra protection on wet and rainy days. [Indoor/outdoor area rugs](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Rugs-Area-Rugs/Interior-Exterior/N-5yc1vZarjgZ1z188ed) are easy to clean and can be used year-round.

## Mudroom Storage Ideas

![Cube storage on a bookshelf placed next to a door.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/7RxvE7Hg_3ic3VT2nOnYCg/6s-DvHamAYsl_dpewI47ow/Original%20file/mudroom-ideas-section-7_07-30-2024.jpg)

There are many possibilities for mudroom storage options. Consider any combination of the following to keep this area neatly organized:  


  * Cube storage or [cube organizers](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Cube-Storage-Cube-Storage-Organizers/N-5yc1vZcg07) offer a versatile place for things like shoes, sporting gear, pet supplies and more. Use cube storage in conjunction with bins and drawers to conceal items.
  * Mudroom cabinets and entryway [lockers](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Lockers/N-5yc1vZc895) work for all your outdoor and seasonal essentials.
  * Trunks are designed specifically for concealed storage. A sturdy [storage trunk](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Storage-Trunks/N-5yc1vZcfzl) can also double as bench seating. Add pillows for a softer place to sit.



## Small Mudroom Ideas

![Storage and a bench built into a small mudroom space. ](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/LgtggvnjMYaUwh95W0DpWA/TJ3_PcMJCVQQDx1-8l09Rw/Original%20file/mudroom-ideas-section-8_07-30-2024.jpg)

You can take advantage of the small mudroom in your home or apartment with a few creative options. Try these small mudroom ideas to make the best use of the limited space.  


  * Try converting an underused closet in the entryway into efficient mudroom space. Remove the door and door hinges. Mount cube storage or wicker-style baskets at eye level for keys, gloves and other small items.
  * Side chairs are versatile furniture pieces designed to complement any part of your home. They’re a great option in smaller mudrooms that cannot accommodate longer benches.
  * Install decorative storage hooks at different heights for umbrellas, clothing, coats and hats.



## Small Mudroom Bench Ideas

Having a proper seat in your mudroom makes it easier to put on and remove shoes and outerwear when you enter and exit. Here are a few popular options:

  * Storage benches built of wood are multifunctional by design. Most are built with lids to offer additional storage.
  * Upholstered benches are cushioned for comfort. Some feature a back for added support. Others have built-in cube storage for shoes and boots.
  * Benches with attached drawers hide stored items from view and double as a seating area.



## Mudroom Wall Decor Ideas

Enhance the aesthetic of your mudroom and make it tie into the rest of your home with:  


  * Wall art and retro-inspired art  
are small touches that can make a large impact.
  * Flush-mount lighting comes in a variety of styles and finishes. Choose lighting that will make a standout impression or subtly enhance the current lighting in your mudroom.



Go beyond decorative wall pieces to create a truly inviting mudroom environment with mirrors.  


  * Add warmth by placing small pillows in any seating areas.
  * Take advantage of any natural light with potted plants. The greenery will brighten up the space.



The mudroom is more than a functional part of the house. Use some imagination to transform this small space into one that is organized and useful. When you are ready for a new look for your mudroom space, get the paint, tools and other essentials you need.
