## Types of Vinyl Flooring

![Vinyl plank flooring installed in a living room.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/F3ni3r33hbbVdsWS07LK5g/7LhDq_jcU9Z846dxFZEd9Q/Original%20file/types-of-flooring-section-1.jpg)

[Vinyl flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring/N-5yc1vZapwr) is extremely durable and cost-effective. It’s made from  
plastic, usually consisting of acrylic, PVC and similar polymers. It's a budget-friendly option for homeowners who want luxurious style and commercial grade durability. Vinyl flooring is available in planks,  
sheets  
or tiles. Since it is scratch- and stain-resistant and waterproof, vinyl flooring is both functional and stylish.

  * Vinyl flooring requires a higher upfront investment, but ideal for heavy traffic areas like kitchens and hallways. It's also easy to install.
  * All types of vinyl flooring  
are available in many different color options.
  * Vinyl can be installed in rolls or in a variety of different shapes, sizes and install methods. These install methods  
include adhesive, peel-and-stick and click-lock. Vinyl can also be installed directly over most existing floors.
  * Vinyl finishes include no-wax, urethane or enhanced urethane. Each offers stain-resistance and a nice shine that does not require polishing or buffing.
  * When shopping for your vinyl flooring, keep the wear layer in mind. This is the top surface of your flooring, usually made of a clear, polyurethane coat. The wear layer makes the flooring waterproof, scratch- and/or stain-resistant. Thickness ranges between 4 to 40 millimeters, with a thicker wear layer making more sense for homes with pets, kids and high traffic.
  * Luxury [vinyl plank flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbzjz) is made to look like hardwood, and [vinyl tile flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Tile-Flooring/N-5yc1vZaq27) is made to look like high-end stones such as marble. [Sheet vinyl flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Sheet-Flooring/N-5yc1vZar9y) can look like wood, stone, slate or other materials.



## Types of Tile Flooring

![Patterned vinyl flooring installed in a small bath.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/rZi8dNl7jr0-J5mlJkXDrg/WAi8at4_DYJ1YN_chgmcwg/Original%20file/types-of-flooring-section-2.jpg)

[Tile flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Tile/N-5yc1vZar0y) is perfect for high-moisture  
rooms that have the potential to get wet, like bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms and basements. Tiles are versatile and can last for many years with little maintenance required. Many tile textures are available that can mimic wood, stone or even fabric.

  * [Ceramic tile](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Tile-Ceramic-Tile/N-5yc1vZarsz) is made from clay and is durable enough for most rooms of the house. It has a softer, more comfortable walking surface compared to other  
types of tile  
flooring.
  * [Porcelain tile](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Tile-Porcelain-Tile/N-5yc1vZb97m) is fired at a higher temperature than ceramic tile, making it more durable, less porous and even  
more water-resistant than ceramic.  
However, it’s also more expensive  
per square foot than ceramic tile.
  * [Natural stone tile](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Tile-Natural-Stone-Tile/N-5yc1vZar8k) includes granite, marble, slate and other  
materials that have an elegant appearance. These tiles can be expensive and sometimes less durable than other types of tile.
  * Other types of tiles include [mosaic glass](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Tile-Mosaic-Tile/N-5yc1vZc8gf), metal, cement and engineered tile.  
Engineered tile  
is created with limestone, bits of marble and other materials like epoxy.
  * Tile flooring can work perfectly in kitchens and bathrooms, but it is also more tedious to install. Certain stones, like marble and slate, require extra care and can stain, scuff or chip easily.



## Types of Laminate Flooring

![Laminate flooring that looks like wood is installed under a king-sized bed.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/4M5Kz1oxn6hPQsQYKexOhQ/XWYiMHxcM85188LqDAKGNw/Original%20file/types-of-flooring-2023-section-2.jpg)

[Laminate flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Laminate-Flooring/N-5yc1vZare1) delivers the look of real wood, tile or stone flooring at budget-friendly price. However, laminate usually requires less maintenance than these traditional types of flooring. Scratch-resistant, waterproof, noise-resistant and heated options are available in a variety of attractive, easy-to-install styles. For these reasons,  
laminate flooring has become a popular choice in many homes.

  * Laminate comes in planks, [tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Laminate-Flooring-Laminate-Floor-Tiles/N-5yc1vZbejq) or squares that feature an interlocking tongue-and-groove assembly. This simplifies installation.
  * Grain styles of [laminate wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Laminate-Flooring-Laminate-Wood-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbejk) mimic the look of pine, maple, cherry, oak and other hardwoods.
  * Other styles of laminate replicate  
the look of stone, marble, limestone, slate and travertine.
  * Durable laminate flooring options hold up well. They're ideal for wet bathroom floors, kitchen spills and wear and tear from pets.



## Types of Hardwood Flooring

[Hardwood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring/N-5yc1vZaq8x) is durable and provides a timeless, elegant look. Certain types of hardwood floors can be refinished up to five times, and you can change the sheen to match a newly decorated room. Area rugs make easy, attractive additions to rooms with hardwood floors. While hardwood flooring requires a higher upfront investment, many homeowners choose it for its longevity and beauty. You can opt to install hardwood flooring on your own or save time by hiring professionals to install your new flooring.

There are two basic types of hardwood flooring. [Solid hardwood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Solid-Hardwood/N-5yc1vZbejw) consists of boards milled from a single piece of solid wood. [Engineered hardwood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/N-5yc1vZb9as) consists of a multi-layer base (made of compressed wood, resin and polymers) with real hardwood on the surface. It can be more budget-friendly than solid hardwood.

  * Hardwood is available in many different types of wood, such as red oak, white oak, cherry, walnut, hickory and maple. Natural hardwood options require regular maintenance and care to preserve their natural appearance.
  * Many engineered hardwoods now have  
waterproof, scratch and dent-resistant options. These choices are ideal for high-moisture areas like kitchens and bathrooms, as well as busy areas like hallways.  
Families with children and pets can also benefit from these types of hardwood flooring choices.



## Hybrid Resilient Flooring

[Hybrid resilient flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hybrid-Resilient-Flooring/N-5yc1vZ2fkpdm6) is low-maintenance, durable and waterproof like vinyl flooring but with the versatile looks of hardwood or stone. It's made of multiple layers and has a vinyl top layer that's resistant to scratches and stains.

## Carpet Flooring

[Carpet](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Carpet/N-5yc1vZarl0) is of course a great choice for rooms where you want extra warmth and comfort underfoot, such as bedrooms and family rooms. Choose your type of carpet based on the room's level of foot traffic, as some carpet textures and piles are more durable than others. There are a few primary [types of carpet](https://www.homedepot.com/c/ab/types-of-carpet/9ba683603be9fa5395fab90fd2f5a2b) and a wide variety of materials available.

  * Cut pile carpet fibers are cut so that the tops of each fiber is a tuft. The fibers can be various heights, twisted or cut at different angles. Some examples include frieze pile, saxony, [textured](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Carpet-Installed-Carpet-Texture-Carpet/N-5yc1vZar36), plush and cable.
  * Loop pile carpet fibers are complete, uncut loops. They include [berber](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Carpet-Installed-Carpet-Berber-Carpet/N-5yc1vZar9l), level loop, multi-level loop and sisal.
  * Cut and loop pile carpets are a combination of these two types of fibers. The textured effect is often a [patterned design](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Carpet-Installed-Carpet-Pattern-Carpet/N-5yc1vZb96x).
  * [Carpet tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Carpet-Carpet-Tile/N-5yc1vZbo4w) are also called modular carpets or carpet squares. As the name suggests, the individual pieces are small shapes, often squares, but they can also be custom designed shapes. Carpet tiles create a variety of visual effects.



## Other Types of Flooring

types of flooring material mentioned above. Here are some other types of floors to consider when making upgrades:

  * [Bamboo flooring](/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Bamboo-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbrfe) is often included in hardwood flooring and is comparable to hardwood's warm, attractive appearance. It’s sustainable and eco-friendly as well as durable and strong. Bamboo comes in a variety of shades, needs little maintenance and is budget friendly.
  * Rubber flooring is available in sheets and tiles that come in multiple colors. Rubber blocks sound and resists moisture, and it's often used in [garage flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Garage-Flooring/N-5yc1vZb97t).
  * [Gym flooring](/b/Flooring-Gym-Flooring/N-5yc1vZb97i), typically made of rubber or foam, is available in interlocking tiles or rolls of sheeting. This type of flooring is created to withstand the wear and tear of gyms and high traffic. It withstands water, reduces noise and absorbs shock.
