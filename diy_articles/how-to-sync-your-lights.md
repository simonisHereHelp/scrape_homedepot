Hubspace gives you the power to create a smart home you can control right from your smart device. Do it all, from adjusting light brightness, controlling fan speeds to creating daily schedules.

Integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant allows you to use voice controls to manage LED lighting and other smart devices around your home. Hubspace is the only smart home solution that allows you to continue controlling your products locally with Bluetooth, in case your Wi-Fi ever goes out.

  * Download the Hubspace app from the app store or the Google Play store to your mobile device.
  * Launch the app.
  * Register an account or log in if you already have an account.
  * Turn on Bluetooth. Access is required for device setup.



Hubspace devices require a 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi Channel. Most routers provide a 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi. Hubspace only shows Wi-Fi networks that your device can use.

If you do not see your Wi-Fi network name when you attempt to connect your device, please check your router settings.

## Add a Device in the Hubspace App

  * In the Hubspace app, tap the plus sign in the upper right corner.
  * Scan your product's QR code. You can find a copy of the QR code on the device itself or printed on the quick start guide in the packaging.
  * If the QR code cannot be scanned, enter the digits of the code manually. Tap the area, then enter the code and follow the instructions.
  * Connect your device to power and follow the instructions on screen.



If your light does not have a QR code, you can put it into Discovery mode with the following sequence: Switch the device off and on five times. The light will pulse to show that it can now be discovered.

  * In the Hubspace app, tap the plus sign in the upper right corner.
  * Follow the instructions to discover devices.
  * More than one device can be added at a time using this method.



## Adjust Your Lights

Once your products are set up in the app, you can design your lighting. Select colors, brightness and even sync some to music.

You can customize even further by seamlessly integrating your smart lights with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa platforms.

Set up your voice assistant in the Hubspace app:

  * Tap the Hubspace button.
  * Select the Integrations tab.
  * Choose your voice assistant and follow the instructions.



Learning how to sync your smart lights is a breeze with Hubspace. The app takes all the work out of setting up the technical side of your LED lights to let you focus on the creative. Outline a shelf with strip lights, twist rope lights into a decorative shape, then choose your colors and light.
