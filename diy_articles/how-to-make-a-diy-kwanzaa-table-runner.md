## How to Make a DIY Stenciled Table Runner for Kwanzaa

![Table decorated with a stenciled table runner, plateware, glasses, and other accessories.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/RicheHolmesGrant-TheRicheLife-2022Kwanzaa-DIYRunner-1.jpg)

## What is Kwanzaa?

My family and many other African Americans celebrate Kwanzaa from December 26 - January 1 to honor our history, culture, communities and families. The word “Kwanzaa” means “first fruits of the harvest” in Swahili and each day of Kwanzaa represents one of seven principles: “Umoja” (unity); “Kujichagulia” (self-determination); “Ujima” (collective work and responsibility); “Ujamaa” (collective economics); “Nia” (purpose); “Kuumba” (creativity); and “Imani” (faith).

  


The official red, black and green Kwanzaa colors represent the people of African descent, our blood, and our hope for the future, respectively.  


## The Kwanzaa Feast

Kwanzaa celebrations culminate with a big feast called the “karamu,” traditionally held on December 31st. This year, I updated my Kwanzaa tablescape using the vast selection of globally-inspired products in The Home Depot tableware collection, including hand-carved pieces by African artisans. All featured items are available at The Home Depot.

The focal point of my table is the DIY [**stenciled**](https://homedepot.com/p/301126054) table runner. A table runner is a great way to add visual interest to a table without taking away from the other elements present. This one is designed to resemble the Kuba cloth that originated in the Kuba kingdom of central Africa, in what is now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

## Directions

  1. Determine the dimensions that you want for your table runner, depending on the size of your table and personal preference. I designed mine to be 12” wide and 45” long to allow room to display the runner without the place settings overlapping. You can design yours to be longer or shorter.

  2. Lay out the [**tablecloth**](https://homedepot.com/p/316712043) on a large, flat surface. Use the [**ruler**](https://homedepot.com/p/100118266) and [**pencil**](https://homedepot.com/p/202263665) to draw lines to mark your selected dimensions. Use [**painter’s tape**](https://homedepot.com/p/100085823) to secure the fabric to your work surface while measuring and cutting.

  3. Use [**shears**](https://homedepot.com/p/313485219) to cut along the reference lines to create the shape of the runner.

  4. Turn the fabric over so that you can see the stitching. Fold the unfinished edges over to create a ¼” hem.



  


  5. Place the fabric [**tape**](https://homedepot.com/p/302628355) along the unfinished edges; it’s helpful to work in smaller, cut sections of tape (about 8-10 inches) at a time.

  6. Peel back the white strip from the fabric tape. Fold the edge over following the indentations from Step 4. Press down to secure the tape.

  7. Repeat Steps 4-6 until you have a hem around all of the unfinished edges.

  8. Use an [**iron**](https://homedepot.com/p/313868909) to smooth out all wrinkles, including the folded edges, if needed.  





![Person ironing a tablecloth.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/RicheHolmesGrant-TheRicheLife-2022Kwanzaa-DIYRunner-7.jpg)

  9. Place a drop cloth down or other covering to protect your work surface from the black [**paint**](https://homedepot.com/p/203709348).

  10. Squeeze about a quarter of the paint bottle into a disposable bowl.

  11. Secure the stencil to one end of the fabric using painter's tape. There’s a triangle in the bottom right corner of the stencil to use a guide when placing it on the fabric; make sure that the triangle is facing up each time that you place the stencil on the fabric to repeat the pattern.

  12. Dip the foam [**brush**](https://homedepot.com/p/100128205) into the paint; be careful not to oversaturate the brush to avoid the paint seeping underneath the stencil.  


  13. Paint the cut-out sections of the stencil.

  14. Let dry for at least five minutes before slowly peeling off the stencil and moving to the next section of the fabric to repeat the pattern.

  15. Repeat steps 11-14 with the stencil pattern until you reach the end of the runner.

  16. Let the runner dry completely before using (approximately one hour).



## The Kwanzaa Dining Table

I placed the finished runner at the center of my table and added complementary African-inspired pieces from The Home Depot collection to complete my gorgeous new Kwanzaa tablescape. The only piece on the table that is not included in the list below is the Chiwara centerpiece sculpture, which was passed down to me from my mother.

Behind the table, I set up my Kwanzaa display with the seven symbols of Kwanzaa. The primary symbol of Kwanzaa is the “kinara” (candle holder), which holds the [**red**](https://homedepot.com/p/315076261), [**black**](https://homedepot.com/p/315076268), and [**green**](https://homedepot.com/p/315076266) candles that each represent one of the seven Kwanzaa principles called the “Nguzo Saba.” I added a modern, chic touch to the traditional wooden kinara design using these [**hand-carved soapstone candle holders**](https://homedepot.com/p/318600990).

Modern Kinara Items:  


  * Soapstone Black Candle Holders
  * Red Taper Candles
  * Black Taper Candles
  * Green Taper Candles



I hope that this easy DIY stenciled Kwanzaa table runner and tablescape design inspire you to get creative with your own karamu this year. Wishing you a very Happy Kwanzaa from my family to yours!
