As a DIY-er and homeowner, I’m always on the lookout for products that would not only look great in our home but are also practical for our family and are made to last.

When the time came to upgrade our kitchen and dining room floors, [LifeProof Sterling Oak 8.7 in. x 47.6 in. Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Lifeproof-Sterling-Oak-8-7-in-W-x-47-6-in-L-Luxury-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring-20-06-sq-ft-case-I966106L/300699284) from The Home Depot was the clear choice for us. Allow me to share some reasons why!

Because of the seemingly endless amount of choices out there, shopping for flooring can be a daunting task. With that said, you can count on The Home Depot to provide expert knowledge and insight that’s only a click, phone call or short drive away. In addition to my research online, The Home Depot’s large LifeProof flooring display really helped me make a great flooring decision for our family.

We are a large family that includes four very energetic kids ranging from 11 to 4. When it comes to the needs of our family, health is the number one concern. When I discovered that LifeProof Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring has no phthalates or formaldehyde, it went to the top of my list of choices.

Like most families with kids, we are also a family of spills! Drink spills happen every day, all day for us. Sometimes, these spills aren’t reported to mom and dad. We find out about them when we discover the bottom of our socks are wet.

Our new LifeProof Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring, which is exclusive to The Home Depot, is 100% waterproof, which gives mom and dad assurance that we won’t have to deal with warped floors every time a drink is knocked over. Clean-up is as simple as using a dust mop, vacuum, or a pH-neutral cleaner. It’s also scratch-resistant, which is nice. But we fully expect to deal with marks and scratches from our VERY active kiddos.

## Easy LifeProof Install

Having installed both hardwood and laminate flooring in a different residence several years ago, a secondary consideration for me was the ease of installation. I can tell you that this flooring is very easy to install!

These floating/interlocking planks have the underlayment already attached to them and no acclimation is required. They can also be installed right over most existing interior surfaces; I installed mine over my existing vinyl sheet floors.

For cuts, these vinyl planks can be scored with a razor knife and snapped. I’m a table saw kinda guy, so I chose to use my saw with a [Diablo laminate-cutting saw blade](https://www.homedepot.com/p/DIABLO-10-in-x-84-Teeth-Laminate-Non-Ferrous-Metal-Cutting-Saw-Blade-D1084L/100660707). Be sure to also pick up a [Roberts Pro Flooring Installation Kit](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Roberts-Pro-Flooring-Installation-Kit-for-Vinyl-Laminate-and-Hardwood-Flooring-10-43/308536659) which makes installing this flooring even easier.

The Zamma Vinyl Multi-Purpose Reducer Molding is another great item to pick up to give a finished look to your new floors next to your existing carpets.

Our rooms feel fresh, new, and lighter thanks to the great color and look that these vinyl planks provide. We chose the Sterling Oak color. But all the LifeProof color choices look great and match the latest trends in flooring.

We are absolutely thrilled about our new LifeProof Luxury Vinyl Plank Floors! Our kids have played on these floors non-stop since I installed them. This was such a great choice for our family that should last for years to come.
