## Measure DIY Closet Space

![A person using a laser to measure a closet wall.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/dwUCPH--dGF52p6J27ZzIQ/HsPPldUzs1ZcEYh4_UwWxw/Original%20file/DIY_closet-organizer-step-1.jpg)

Crafting your own DIY closet organizer is simple. You just need enough time and a little know-how. Start by measuring accurately. Accurate measurements are the secret to building a closet organizer that works best for your space.

  * Measure the back wall and two side walls of your closet space. (Youâ€™ll use these measurements to determine the length of the shelf supports.)
  * Deduct 1 1/2 inches from the length of the back wall shelf support measurement. This will account for the 3/4-inch thickness of each side wall support.



## Measure Pieces for DIY Closet Shelves

You'll use 3/4-inch [plywood](/b/Lumber-Composites-Plywood/N-5yc1vZbqm7) to make this closet organizer. Measure out:

  * Six 1-inch x 3-inch boards. The lengths will be based on the back and side wall measurements in Step 1.
  * Two boards that are 11 7/8 inches wide. Use the length that fits the width of your closet in Step 1.
  * Six 11 7 /8-inch square shelves for the central unit.
  * Two 11 7 /8-inch side pieces for the central shelf unit.



## Cut Shelf Supports

You will install your finished DIY closet organization system on shelf supports. Cut the six 1-inch x 3-inch shelf supports you measured out of the plywood in Step 2. These pieces are for the top and bottom of the closet walls.

## Cut the Shelves

Next, measure and use a [circular saw](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Saws-Circular-Saws/N-5yc1vZc2dc) to cut the following plywood pieces for your DIY closet shelves.

  * Six 11 7/ 8-inch square shelves for the central unit.
  * Six 1-inch x 3-inch boards with lengths based on the back and side wall measurements in Step 1.
  * Two 11 7 /8-inch wide closet shelves with lengths based on the closet width measurement in Step 1.



## Attach Shelf Support to Wall

![Man using a drill to screw a board to the closet wall.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/od-RgcakykSpfQkeIcTP3A/VBQDlDY3BJTmAU5wH_SlFQ/Original%20file/DIY_closet-organizer-step-5.jpg)

Your shelf support pieces will bear most of the weight of the central shelf unit. It's important to attach them to the studs.

  * Use a [stud finder](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Stud-Finders/N-5yc1vZc23h) to find the studs in the back wall and the two side walls of your closet space.
  * Attach the supports for the top shelf to the walls with their top edges 84 inches above the floor using wood screws.
  * Attach the supports for the bottom shelf to the wall with their top edges 76 inches above the floor using wood screws.



## Assemble Central Unit

![A person using screws to secure the boards for center section of the closet organizer.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/I6AVE6p6UFE1f3UMAmjcbw/g5E9UhOSbpiRdYqxhACQ1g/Original%20file/DIY_closet-organizer-step-6.jpg)

  * Use [wood screws](/b/Hardware-Fasteners-Screws-Wood-Screws/N-5yc1vZc2bl) or finishing nails to put the center of your DIY closet organization system together.
  * Space the shelves evenly. Or choose spacing based on the height of the items you plan to store.
  * Leave the top and bottom of the unit open.



## Place Central Unit in Closet

![A person drilling a lower shelf into place on top of the shelf supports.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/LLYAedFouG9R1nFs88QHNg/Q6M492-6HSngsMKtUbsoWA/Original%20file/DIY_closet-organizer-step-7.jpg)

  * Position the central shelf unit to be the middle of the DIY closet system.
  * Cut any excess wood out with a [hand saw](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Cutting-Tools-Hand-Saws/N-5yc1vZc26q) so the unit fits into the support board.
  * Take your time here and avoid removing too much wood.



## Install Long Shelves

  * Lay one of the long DIY closet shelves on the lower shelf supports. It will be on top of the central shelf unit.
  * Attach each long shelf with wood screws or 6d finishing nails.



Tip: Add metal [shelving brackets](/b/Storage-Organization-Shelving-Shelving-Hardware-Shelving-Brackets/N-5yc1vZckss) in the corners of the long shelves for extra support.

## Screw-In Closet Shelving Alternatives

One of the most popular DIY closet organization options are freestanding closet shelving. It comes in a wide range of designs and styles. Simply measure your available space and look for a unit that will fit.

  * [Freestanding wire organizers](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Closet-Organizers-Wire-Closet-Organizers-Wire-Closet-Systems/N-5yc1vZcd8r) come with one or more shelves.
  * [Freestanding organizers in wood](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Closet-Organizers-Wood-Closet-Organizers-Wood-Closet-Systems/N-5yc1vZcd8v) have a combination of shelves and drawers. These customizable closet systems have the look of built-in luxury.
  * A [freestanding plastic closet system](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Closet-Organizers-Portable-Closets/Plastic/N-5yc1vZclmpZ1z0utj8) may have a hanging rod and shelves and storage baskets.
  * Wire storage organizers can have drawers and baskets. Some are freestanding. Others hang over a door.



Choose from basic wire storage systems to high-end wood organizers that are perfect for upscale bedrooms. Ready-made and ready-to-assemble closet organizers are also available.

Tip: Large organizers may need to be assembled. Make sure they are anchored to a wall for safety and stability. Read the instructions that come with your unit for details.

Turn your closet into a better functioning space with a DIY closet organization system or DIY closet shelves. A closet organizer is something you can build for bedroom closets and more. Plus, building a closet system is the perfect solution for uniquely shaped closets or other odd spaces.
