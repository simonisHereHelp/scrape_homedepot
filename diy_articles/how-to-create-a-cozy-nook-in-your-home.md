Whether it's a totally empty wall in your house or a corner that's become more of a catchall for storage, odds are it could use a refresh. The smallest section of any room needs just a little bit of creative thinking to make it functional. Even just rearranging furniture can change the entire look and feel of a room. This guide will give you tips and ideas to help you create a cozy nook in your house, so you can unwind, read books and create an escape without having to leave home.

While this will work for any area or room in your home, one of our favorite transformations is turning an unused corner into a reading nook. It’s super satisfying to give any room a fresh perspective while also creating a little space for yourself –  
bonus points if the corner is near a window for natural light to read by.

Choose a spot in the house where you can create a relaxing vibe. If your home is often busy, filled with family, or your space acts as your office during the week, carving out a little corner for yourself can help you unwind.  


## Define the Space

Because this cozy nook is being set up in a corner of a room, you want to make sure to define the space. Laying down a [rug](/b/Flooring-Rugs/N-5yc1vZarfm) in whatever style you prefer will not only create definition but will warm up the nook, keeping your feet comfy and providing support for furniture.

Tip: Don’t be afraid to pull the rug out from the wall a bit – this will make the nook appear like an intentional part of the room’s design.   


## Add in Seating

Nothing says cozy nook like comfy seating. A good [chair](/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-Chairs/N-5yc1vZc7py) can make it even easier to unwind with a book after a long day. Be sure to take the size of your space into account when adding in any seating.  


## Bring in a Bookshelf

Perfect for housing all your favorite books as well as displaying plants, candles and more, a [bookshelf](/b/Furniture-Home-Office-Furniture-Bookcases-Bookshelves/N-5yc1vZc7o5) can also act as part table if your corner is quaint but small on space. Keep in mind that while any type of bookshelf will work, a vertical shelf will draw the eye up and make the space seem more open.  


If you’re looking for a new way to organize your books, try arranging them by color, and alternating between traditional vertical placement and horizontal stacks for visual interest. Add decorative objects among the stacks, using heavy objects for bookends, vases and plants for a bit of greenery and leaning frames for natural separation between sections.  


## Add in Details

While natural light is always preferred for relaxing spaces, a good light is a must, especially for rainy days or evenings spent in the nook. A sleek [floor lamp](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Floor-Lamps/N-5yc1vZc7no) eliminates the need for a side table and can provide good overhead lighting for reading.  


## Pile on Extras 

![A plush leather pouf is placed on top of the rug.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-create-a-cozy-nook-in-your-home-step-6.jpg)

One of the most important elements of the nook: the cozy extras. When it comes to comfy [pillows](/b/Home-Decor-Throw-Pillows/N-5yc1vZc1ky) and [blankets](/b/Home-Decor-Throw-Blankets/N-5yc1vZcfae), pile on the details. This spot is meant to be as warm and inviting as you want it to be, so have fun with the colors and textures of the throws and pillows.  


Additionally, a corner often means there's not a lot of space for a couch or spacious seating. Adding in a plush pouf or ottoman can help you kick back and relax when your legs need a little extra stretch.  


## Inspiration

Look for inspiration: The internet is full of inspiration for reading nooks – but you don’t have to limit yourself to just one search term.  


  * Make a mood board: Save photos of rooms with throw pillows you like, chairs that look comfy and color schemes you want to emulate. Save them all to one folder on your phone or computer so you can create a mood board or look back at them when looking for items to furnish your nook.
  * Narrow down the items you'll need: Since this is a small space, you don't want to overwhelm the area with too much.
  * Use what you have: Try moving furniture from another room in the house to this area, and work from there.
