## Prep the Frame

![Person removes backing from frame](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-make-a-chicken-wire-frame-2023-step-2.jpg)

Select the size of picture frame you would like. Use a [utility knife](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Knives-Blades-Knives-Utility-Knives/N-5yc1vZ1z18gf5) to remove any cardboard or paper backing.

Remove photos and glass from the frame. Make sure there is no remaining paper sticking out from the sides of the frame.  


## Remove the Frame Hardware

![Person uses steel nose pliers to remove staples](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-make-a-chicken-wire-frame-2023-step-3.jpg)

Remove any hardware with steel nosed pliers. Be sure to remove the tabs that hold the picture and glass in place.  


If there is glass, remove it and set it aside. You won't need it for this project.

## Clean the Frame

![Person cleans frame with shop cloth](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-make-a-chicken-wire-frame-2023-step-4.jpg)

Use a cleaning agent and paper towel to wipe off any dust and dirt from the frame before painting.  


Let the frame completely dry before applying paint.  


## Spray Paint the Frame

![Person spray paints frame ](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-make-a-chicken-wire-frame-2023-step-5.jpg)

Personalize your project with the paint color of your choice.  


Follow these steps to apply spray paint:

  * Use a well-ventilated area such as a garage or yard. If you're indoors, wear a ventilator mask and eye protection
  * Disposable [nitrile gloves](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Disposable-Gloves-Nitrile-Gloves/N-5yc1vZ2fkowh9) make cleanup easier.
  * Lay your frame on a piece of cardboard that provides an ample border around all sides.
  * Take your spray paint can and hold it six inches away from the frame.
  * Move the paint in a steady, constant motion until your frame is covered.
  * Let the frame dry until it is no longer sticky.



Tip: If your frame has a glossy sheen to it, lightly sand the gloss off to provide a surface for the paint to adhere to.  


## Measure the Frame

![Person measures the frame with a tape measure](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-make-a-chicken-wire-frame-2023-step-6.jpg)

Once the frame dries, the next step is measuring.

Flip the frame over and use a tape measure to find the height and width. You'll use these measurements to cut the chicken wire.

## Cut the Chicken Wire

![Person measures and cuts the chicken wire](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-make-a-chicken-wire-frame-2023-step-7.jpg)

Carefully roll out the chicken wire and cut it to the length and width based on the frame measurement. Add an extra inch or two all around to ensure the chicken wire covers the entire frame.

Tip: Always wear leather gloves, long sleeves and eye protection when working with poultry netting. Wire cutters and [aviation snips](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Cutting-Tools-Snips/N-5yc1vZc235) are best for cutting chicken wire.

## Use a Hand Stapler

![Person uses a hand stapler to attach chicken wire to frame](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-make-a-chicken-wire-frame-2023-step-8.jpg)

  * Flatten the sheet of chicken wire as best you can so there are no waves or bumps.
  * Use a hand stapler or upholstery stapler to secure the chicken wire to the back of the frame.
  * Apply as many staples as needed, making sure to get a staple in each corner and two on each side at minimum.



## Trim and Flatten

![Person trims chicken wire by edge of frame](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-make-a-chicken-wire-frame-2023-step-9.jpg)

  * After your sheet of chicken wire is stapled to the back of the frame, use wire cutters to trim the excess chicken wire into the inside of the frame.
  * Hammer the staples and existing wire until flattened.
  * Leave as few sharp edges as possible.



## Cut Backing

![Person uses scissors to cut backing for frame](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-make-a-chicken-wire-frame-2023-step-10.jpg)

Measure the width and height of the backside of your frame again and use those measurements to cut out strips from the foam or felt material for protective backing to cover any remaining sharp edges.  


## Glue Backing

![Person uses a glue gun to attach backing to frame](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-make-a-chicken-wire-frame-2023-step-11.jpg)

Glue the strips of foam or felt to the backside of the frame with a hot glue gun. The foam or felt material strips will protect your walls when you hang the frame.  


## Attach Hangers

![Person hammers hanger on frame](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-make-a-chicken-wire-frame-2023-step-12.jpg)

  * Decide if you want your frame to hang vertically or horizontally.
  * Attach one sawtooth hanger in the center of the back of the top edge.



## Hang Frame
