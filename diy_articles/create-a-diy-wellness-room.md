## Select Space and Wellness Activities

Ideally, choose a medium-sized, quiet space that’s large enough for your activities but still inviting and airy. The right light has a dramatic effect on energy and mood, so your wellness room should have windows.

Think about what makes your body and soul feel better. Do you want to knock out some cardio, curl up with a good book or stretch to a lo-fi jazz track? By planning out the wellness activities you’re interested in, you can make sure you have the right equipment and enough room.

## Set the Mood

A wellness room should be a delight for all the senses. Enhance your peace of mind by layering in soft ambient overhead lighting, accent string lights and lamps with natural light bulbs. Use dimmer switches to match your lighting to your wellness activities in the evening. Treat your walls to paint colors such as muted pastels or soft earthy tones that give a sense of tranquility.

## Get Personal

  * Hang motivating elements such as meaningful art, inspirational quotes and vision boards.
  * Add cozy texture and comfort with a vintage throw, handmade blanket or embroidered pillow.
  * Install a sound system or use Bluetooth speakers for your soothing music playlist.
  * Get a sound machine for calming nature sounds or white noise.



## Add a Vertical Plant Wall

Few things promote well-being and happiness like plants do. Being around nature reduces stress and boosts mood. Bring life and freshness into your new wellness room with a wall filled with your favorite houseplants. Here’s a few tips for making a vertical plant wall:

  * Pick a spot where there’s ample natural light.
  * Install a pre-made vertical plant wall.
  * Plant low-maintenance, small indoor plants like succulents or snake plants.
  * Use additional wall-mounted planters or unique hanging pots to add interest.
  * Place plants based on size, larger plants at the bottom and the smaller ones at the top.
  * Consider installing a drip irrigation system for convenience.
  * Prune or replace plants when needed.



## Keep It Simple and Organized

It doesn't take much to create the ideal wellness room. Stick to the basics:

  * Strength: Bring in a yoga mat and free weights.
  * Cardio: Invest in a walking pad or foldable exercise bike.
  * Resting: Cozy things up with an overstuffed chair and bookshelves.



Plus, don’t let clutter and disorganization spoil your serenity.

  * Use decorative baskets to store wellness equipment or workout gear.
  * Put catch-all bins and trays throughout the room to keep small items organized.
  * Invest in double-duty ottomans and daybeds with built in compartments or drawers.
  * Hang wall shelves or organizers to keep essentials off the floor and out of the way.



## Budget-Friendly Ideas

Creating a wellness room at home doesn't have to be complicated or require a large upfront investment. If you have a modest budget:

  * Perk up your mood with your favorite incense, essential oil sprays, scented candles or diffusers.
  * Fill a drawer with memories from your travels such as indulgent aromatherapy lotions and masks.
  * Re-purpose some sturdy, functional furniture pieces from other rooms of your home. Give your “finds” a fresh look with new paint or stain.
  * Transform existing cushions by covering them in bold patterns or iconic fabric motifs.
  * Browse thrift shops for perfectly fine, used equipment such as free weights or yoga mats.



## Enjoy Your Wellness Room

Your wellness room is peaceful, comfortable and fills you with positive energy. Get the most out of it with these tips:

  * Set and stick to boundaries. Let everyone know this is your private, personal space and is an “by invite only” room.
  * Schedule consistent time in your wellness room each day.
  * Make it a habit to focus on your well-being for a minimum of 30 minutes a day. Break it into 15 minutes in the morning and 15 at night if that works best with your schedule.
  * Change up your décor or wellness activities to match the season. Try incorporating some outdoor time in your routine.
  * Consider investing in a professional cleaning for your wellness room every 3 months or so. It’s a wonderful way to reward yourself for taking care of you.



Design a wellness room that’s an uplifting and rejuvenating space. Choose a medium-size, light-filled room. Add in practical equipment for your favorite wellness activities.
