The Home Depot: The One-Stop Shop for Transformation




![The space before the transformation.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/1zazqavJm8XEpytKVtxcqg/3gWUzPEAL2jmlru3JUm_hQ/Original%20file/IyonnaShannon-FY25MakeItHome-Image-1.jpeg)

When I first purchased my home, my basement was anything but inspiring. With its bland beige walls and lack of character, it felt more like an afterthought than a space full of potential. But I saw something different. I saw a chance to create something truly special. I envisioned an intimate, stylish speakeasy lounge where I could merge my love for music, the ‘70s and rich textures into a one-of-a-kind space.

## A Secret Entrance for a True Speakeasy Feel

![A close-up of a door in the corner.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/HXlWOHBitXcy6gjqAdvlUg/d10fW2XyXv7-iBgMcRYGLg/Original%20file/IyonnaShannon-FY25MakeItHome-Image-3.jpeg)

What’s a speakeasy without a little mystery? To enhance the theme, I created a hidden entrance by installing [wooden acoustic paneling](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-Wood-Slat-Acoustic-Wall-Panels-2PC-Brown-0-83-in-x-23-8-in-x-94-5-in-31-Sq-Ft-Case-JM1114-624-B111/325911848 "Everbilt Wood Slat Acoustic Wall Panels 2PC Brown 0.83 in. x 23.8 in x 94.5 in.\(31 Sq.Ft./Case\)") on both the door and the surrounding wall. The panels were installed using a [brad nailer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-ONE-18V-18-Gauge-Cordless-AirStrike-Brad-Nailer-with-4-0-Ah-Battery-and-Charger-P321K1/326480109 "RYOBI ONE+ 18V 18-Gauge Cordless AirStrike Brad Nailer with 4.0 Ah Battery and Charger") and a [miter saw](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-ONE-HP-18V-Brushless-Cordless-10-in-Sliding-Compound-Miter-Saw-Kit-with-4-0-Ah-Battery-Charger-and-Miter-Saw-Stand-PBLMS01K-A18MS01G/324696120 "RYOBI ONE+ HP 18V Brushless Cordless 10 in. Sliding Compound Miter Saw Kit with 4.0 Ah Battery, Charger, and Miter Saw Stand") to make the perfect cuts. This disguised the entrance and gave the space an exclusive, tucked-away feel—just like a real speakeasy. The before is a terror! But the after is a dream!

## Setting the Mood with Color & Lighting

To bring my vision to life, I knew I needed deep, moody hues to set the tone. The most transformative elements of this project were paint and [flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Home-Decorators-Collection-Chestnut-Street-Oak-12-MIL-x-7-in-W-x-42-in-L-Waterproof-Click-Lock-Luxury-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring-20-79-sqft-case-VTRHDCHESTR7X42/327432242 "Home Decorators Collection Chestnut Street Oak 12 MIL x 7 in. W x 42 in. L Waterproof Click Lock Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring \(20.79 sqft/case\)"). I drenched the walls in [Behr’s Divine Wine](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-DYNASTY-1-qt-PPU1-02-Divine-Wine-Matte-Interior-Stain-Blocking-Paint-Primer-165304/315929420 "BEHR DYNASTY 1 qt. #PPU1-02 Divine Wine Matte Interior Stain-Blocking Paint & Primer") in the Dynasty line, a bold yet inviting shade that instantly warmed up the space. Paired with uplighting and [greenery](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Nearly-Natural-Indoor-6-ft-Paradise-Palm-Artificial-Tree-5260/202065565 "Nearly Natural Indoor 6 ft. Paradise Palm Artificial Tree"), the room took on a sultry, lounge-like atmosphere perfect for entertaining.

## The Bar That Started It All

Every great speakeasy needs a statement bar and I found mine in the most unexpected place—a [reception desk](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BYBLIGHT-Moronia-63-in-Front-Reception-Counter-Desk-Black-and-Brown-Wood-Executive-Computer-Desk-Workstation-with-LED-Lights-BB-YS0229HY/332577532 "BYBLIGHT Moronia 63 in. Front Reception Counter Desk, Black and Brown Wood Executive Computer Desk Workstation with LED Lights") from [HomeDepot.com](https://www.homedepot.com "Home Depot")! With a little creativity, I transformed it into the ultimate serving station, proving that innovation is the key to great design.

To complement the bar, I added [LED display cabinetry](https://www.homedepot.com/p/FUFU-GAGA-Black-Wood-47-2-in-W-Buffet-Food-Pantry-W-Hutch-Glass-Doors-Multiple-Shelves-LED-Lights-14-2-in-D-x-78-7-in-H-KF020374-012/326864970 "FUFU&GAGA Black Wood 47.2 in. W Buffet Food Pantry W/Hutch, Glass Doors, Multiple Shelves, LED Lights \(14.2 in. D x 78.7 in. H\)")—a sleek and upscale way to showcase my glassware and record collection. This not only added function but also enhanced the ambiance, making the space feel high-end yet inviting.

## Lounge-Worthy Seating

Comfort was a top priority and I found the perfect [curved velvet couch](https://www.homedepot.com/p/HOMEFUN-126-in-Straight-Arm-Chenille-Curved-Modular-Large-Sectional-Sofa-Oversized-Couch-Sofa-with-Pillows-in-Wine-Red-HFHDSN-1005RD/332599376 "HOMEFUN 126 in. Straight Arm Chenille Curved Modular Large Sectional Sofa Oversized Couch Sofa with Pillows in. Wine Red") on HomeDepot.com. Plush, stylish and the ultimate statement piece, it anchors the room beautifully. To complete the lounge vibe, I paired it with two café tables and four chairs, mimicking the feel of an intimate bar setting.

I also incorporated [black velvet armchairs](https://www.homedepot.com/p/JAYDEN-CREATION-Estefan-Black-Polyester-Arm-Chair-with-Metal-Swivel-Base-Set-of-2-CHM0240-BLACK-S2/320981402 "JAYDEN CREATION Estefan Black Polyester Arm Chair with Metal Swivel Base\(Set of 2\)") and a stunning marble side table to introduce natural materials into the space. The mix of textures—soft velvet, sleek marble and warm wood—added depth and sophistication.

## A Total Flooring Transformation

The biggest game-changer? New flooring. The old, outdated floors needed a serious facelift, so I installed click-lock LVP flooring. As a beginner DIY’er, I was thrilled at how easy the process was! The result? A polished foundation that tied everything together.

From couches to cabinetry, bar essentials to [lighting](https://www.homedepot.com/p/JONATHAN-Y-Xavier-12-5-in-Brass-Gold-White-Modern-Minimalist-Iron-Rechargeable-Integrated-LED-Table-Lamp-JYL7109C/321739793 "JONATHAN Y Xavier 12.5 in. Brass Gold/White Modern Minimalist Iron Rechargeable Integrated LED Table Lamp"), furniture to flooring, accents to bulbs, The Home Depot had everything I needed to bring my speakeasy vision to life. With a little creativity and the right materials, I turned my once-forgotten basement into a moody, music-inspired retreat—complete with a hidden entrance!
