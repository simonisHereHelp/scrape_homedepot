Prior to setting the table, you'll want to create your place cards. You can use builder's paper to make place settings more personal.  


  * Grab your builder's paper and cut a rectangle. The rectangle should be about the size of a 4-inch x 7-inch card.
  * Fold the rectangle in half, so it can stand up like a tent.
  * Neatly write each person's name on the card using your marker. Feel free to practice a few times on scratch paper before making the final card. Add a little personality with doodles or different fonts if you'd like.



## Roll Napkins

Rolled napkins add a sweet, aesthetic touch to your table. It shows care and lends the air to sense of intimacy. Here's how you roll napkins and add a delicate touch:

  * Neatly roll up a napkin (either a solid or printed one).
  * Fasten a napkin ring of your choice around it.
  * To tie the meal together, pull a few sprigs of herbs you're using to cook. Good options are rosemary, sage, tarragon and thyme.
  * Tuck them into the ring.



## Lay Down Place Settings

After your napkins are rolled and your place cards are ready, you can start setting the table. Here's how to create unique place settings for each individual person:

  * Clear your dining table completely.
  * Measure out a length of builder’s paper that will cover it. Measure to ensure there’s overhang on the edges of the table.
  * Tape the paper to the underside of the table’s edges.
  * Smooth out any air bubbles that may form under the paper.
  * At the center of each setting, lay down a place mat.



## Set the Table

Everything is in place, and it's time to get the dinner party started.

  * Set a dinner plate down in the center of each place mat. If using, stack a salad plate on top of the dinner plate.
  * Place your napkins, herbs facing up, on top of the stacked plates.
  * Place a glass to the upper right of the plates.
  * Arrange the utensils in the correct order. Place the salad fork and the dinner fork to the left of the plates. Place the knife and the spoon to the right of them.
  * Repeat steps 1 through 4 for every seat at the table. Alternate which napkins, napkin rings and herbs per setting.
  * Scatter metallic markers around the table. Add extra closer to where any children might be seated. During the meal, encourage doodling on the paper tablecloth.



Tip: If you’re concerned about spills, measure out several sets of builder's paper. Layer them on top of one another and tape them to your table.  


## Add a Centerpiece

No tablescape is complete without a statement-making centerpiece. You can go the homemade route or buy a premade centerpiece.

  * Set up the centerpiece in the middle of the table. If you have leftover herbs, feel free to nestle any sprigs around the display.
  * If your centerpiece has room for candles, light them as everyone sits down.



## Enjoy the Gathering

The table's set, the family is seated and it's time to give thanks. Enjoy your cozy tablescape and the conversations and love around it.

  * Play games with markers and builder's paper. Have guests guess which herb their place setting included.
  * Enjoy your meal and share stories to keep the laughter going.
