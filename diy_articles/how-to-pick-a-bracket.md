## Choose Your Bracket

![Four different brackets lay on a table. ](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/WtBgvsHkR7KrDQDsvz0usA/Rr4MLm6V5O1wNSLBUHDRqQ/Original%20file/how-to-pick-a-bracket-section-1.jpg)

Traditional, [wall-mounted shelves](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Shelving-Wall-Mounted-Shelves/N-5yc1vZckso) can take on new life with the help of decorative [shelf brackets](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Shelving-Shelving-Hardware-Shelving-Brackets/Brackets/N-5yc1vZckssZ1z18d8l). Rather than the typical L-shaped resting spot, unconventional shelf supports will add interest to your space and allow you to better match your decor. For instance, rope supports would mesh well with farmhouse decor, while pipes give shelving a distinctly industrial vibe.  


You can make standard brackets more interesting with a simple coat of paint. Plain metal shelf supports can be painted to blend in or stand out against the wall color, and there are even specialty [spray paint](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Paint-Spray-Paint/N-5yc1vZapz5) options that will give you metallic, mirrored or textured finishes for a truly bold statement.

Note: Pay careful attention to the manufacturer's instructions regarding weight limits as you try out your decorative shelf ideas. Going over the limit could result in the shelf failing, causing all the items on it to crash to the ground.

## Hanging Flower Baskets

While you can use brackets by themselves to add to your decor, adding hanging flower baskets are a great adornment. Choose self-watering, coconut fiber, clay or plastic [hanging planters](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Outdoors-Garden-Center-Planters-Hanging-Planters/N-5yc1vZbx7b) to hold real or artificial flowers. You can hang them from decorative brackets in any room where you want to add a splash of nature.

## Shoe Wall

Once you’ve chosen the type of bracket you want, it’s time to build shelving systems that meet your needs. If you have lots of shoes to organize, a shoe wall in your closet can be the answer. A shoe wall keeps your footwear off the floor and makes your collection visually appealing. You can organize them by color, type, ranked by favorites or any way you prefer.

## Garage Storage
