She has a passion for creating, building, designing and most of all, making spaces look beautiful. She loves a good challenge, as well as a good laugh! Her mission is to learn, teach and inspire others throughout her DIY journey designing high-end, yet affordable spaces and having fun along the way. Before and afters are great, but it’s the ups, downs and all the in-between that really make the project!   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Our Bathroom Before  2. 2  Getting Started  3. 3  Removing the Old Vanity, Toilet, Flooring, Trim  4. 4  Prepping the Bathroom Walls and Floors  5. 5  Painting the Ceiling and Trim  6. 6  Tiling the Floor     See More  ## Our Bathroom Before  !The original bathroom prior to the transformation.  Original Before  !The bathroom after the original transformation, prior to the completed transformation.  After the original before, but before this renovation.  ## Getting Started  If you are like me, your style has changed over the years or you have a dated, untouched space. Or maybe you have a space that you made some simple updates to temporarily, but it’s not your end goal. Regardless, you find yourself staring, dreaming, imagining…what it could be. Last year, we had a flood in our basement that kickstarted this whole renovation. It was devastating at first, but in the end, it has given me the opportunity to turn it into the swanky basement bathroom of my dreams! For this project, we are going to install penny tile with a really fun design, incorporate wallpaper and one-by-six boards for a unique and funky wall treatment and then we will bring in a stunning new vanity from the Home Decorators Collection. They have so many gorgeous, designer style vanities to choose from!   Here is my design plan.  !The mood board of the transformation.  ## Removing the Old Vanity, Toilet, Flooring, Trim  First, out with the old. To get started, I had to demo the rest of the bathroom, which was not bad and actually kind of fun. I removed all the trim, the remaining LVP flooring and the old vanity.  In order to remove the vanity, I started by turning off the water and disconnecting the plumbing. Once the vanity was out, we had to remove the toilet. This wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. We turned}}<|eot_id|>"}

Always make sure to seal the drain by placing a rag in the pipe to block sewer gases. Next, I pulled up the old flooring. We had LVP (luxury vinyl plank) flooring which is very easy to remove. Essentially, it’s just floating planks, so nothing is actually stuck to the floor. Next, I removed all of the old trim. To remove the trim, I always use a trim puller. It is my go-to demo tool, and I use it ALL the time. I will be replacing my trim, but if you were hoping to reuse it, the trim puller does not mess up your trim and makes it so easy to remove.  ## Prepping the Bathroom Walls and Floors  Before we can get to the fun stuff, we have to prep everything. Not the most fun part of a renovation, but it really is important. I started by removing any existing screws from the walls. I am going to add new pendant lights above the vanity, so I had my electrician come and rewire the lighting so the lights could be hung from the ceiling. Next, I patched all my holes. You will want to patch any holes or imperfections with spackle, let dry, repeat if needed and sand until smooth. Even if you are covering the walls with wallpaper, they need to be smooth first, otherwise you will see imperfections through the wallpaper. After patching, make sure to prime your walls. Wallpaper will not stick to drywall or spackle. If you are painting your walls, you will still need to prime to ensure the paint covers evenly. You’ll want to check the condition of the subfloor to ensure it’s in good shape before moving on to your new flooring choice. Since we are working in the basement, I’m dealing with concrete so that makes it easy on me! Since there was carpet in this bathroom a zillion years ago (gross I know), I did have to scrape up some residue. I used my Husky 15-in-one tool and everything came up easily.  ## Painting the Ceiling and Trim  !A paint can on the floor.  I started by painting my ceiling and trim, so I didn’t have to worry about getting any on my floor. I really love painted ceiling, and I feel like it really elevates a room. I used BEHR Dynasty paint in the color Green Scene. For the ceiling I used a matte sheen and for the trim and door I used a satin sheen. I have included my favorite brushes and rollers\") in my product list.  ## Tiling the Floor  !Partially completed penny tiles of the bathroom floor.

I am adding a border and words in the middle! First, I did a dry fit, laying all the tile out, except for the letters – that will come later. After I was confident in my layout, I started removing a row of tiles in the back of the bathroom. I used a trowel to spread thinset onto the concrete. I then carefully placed my tiles back and pressed them into the thinset. You want to make sure you don’t use too much thinset, because it will seep through the tiles. Also, make sure you check your tiles CONSTANTLY to assure you have what we call “the flower” or else you could end up with a floor that shows the square sheets of penny tile. I removed the tiles, added thinset and secured them row by row until the entire room was done. I let this dry overnight. For the letters, I first placed the black penny tiles on top of the white\") so I could visualize the spacing. Then I marked each of the white tiles with a little dot, so I knew which ones to remove. I used a flat head screwdriver and popped up the marked tiles. Once they were up, I cleaned out any excess dried thinset. I then added the black penny tiles. To do this, I put thinset into a Ziplock bag and cut the tip (like you would apply icing on a cake). This allowed me to squeeze out a little on each tile and press onto the floor. Read the label on your thinset to determine how long it needs to dry before grouting. Once dry, you are ready for grout! Grab plenty of sponges\") and buckets of water because you’re going to need them! Using a grout float, scoop the grout out and press it into the tile. Make sure you angle the grout float to remove excess grout. Do this in small areas as you do not want to leave the grout on the tile for too long. Use water and sponges to wipe off any remaining excess grout. Also, be sure to refresh your water constantly, if it looks “milky” the grout could adhere to the top of your tile, making your end project look very messy. Once the entire floor is grouted, refer to the products suggested drying time. If you have any grout haze, you can use a grout haze remover. Once you’re happy with the look of your tile and grout, go ahead and seal it.  !A person installing the penny tiles on the floor.!A close-up of the penny tiles.!Overview of the penny tiles during the installation.!Overview of the completed penny tiles.  ## Wall Treatment  !A person installing the wallpaper.  I started by wallpapering the entire room. I used pre-pasted wallpaper\") which was fairly easy}}<|eot_id|>"}

Simply spray the back with water and like magic, it activates the paste! Start in an inconspicuous corner. The reason for this is that when you have wallpapered the entire room, there is a high probability that the seams will not line up properly between the first piece laid and the last piece. Also, always make sure your first piece is completely level, as it is the template that you will be basing your entire room on. Make sure you get wallpaper smoother and razor blade to smooth it out and cut off excess wallpaper. PRO TIP: Always order EXTRA wallpaper, because running out is no fun! And you can always return any roles that you do not use. For the vertical boards as well as the floor trim, I used one-by-six trim boards. I decided to use my sprayer to spray these all at once. Next, I installed my floor trim in which I used a miter saw to create my 45-degree cuts. After the floor trim was installed, I was ready to install my vertical boards. I highly suggest laying them out before installing them. I used a spare board as a spacer to make sure they were evenly distributed. I like to measure each board vs. cutting them all the same size, because my walls are usually not level. Installing them was simple, I just used my brad nailer!  !A close-up of the wallpaper.  ## Finally! Ready to Install the Vanity  !A close-up of the bathroom vanity.  Now for the star of the show, the Anabelle 48-inch vanity\") in Drift of Mist from the Home Decorators Collection, available exclusively at The Home Depot. This vanity is the perfect blend of style and functionality. The Home Decorators Collection had so many beautiful vanities to choose from. Their search function was awesome! I was able to search based on the size and features I was looking for. The Anabelle vanity is absolutely STUNNING! I really was so impressed with the quality of this vanity. The soft close hinges, arched door details, the color, the quartz top – everything is so perfect! It really is amazing how something as simple as an updated vanity can totally change the look of a space. I never realized how disproportioned our old vanity was. The vanity shipped straight to my door pre-assembled, which made it easy on me! The new vanity looks SO much better and actually makes the room look bigger! Installing the vanity was not bad at all. Depending on where your plumbing is, you may have to make some cuts out of the back with a multi tool. Then all that is left is to reconnect the plumbing and add}}<|eot_id|>"}

They can also add an extra touch of style to your home decor. Whether you're replacing an old fan, updating an existing room or building a new home, this guide will help you find the best ceiling fans for your style, ceiling height, size of your space and your budget.

When choosing a new ceiling fan, it's important to think about where you plan to hang it. Will the ceiling fan installation take place in a living room or are you searching for the best outdoor ceiling fan to cool off things on your patio?   Wet/damp ratings indicate whether a ceiling fan is recommended for indoor or outdoor purposes. If you plan to hang a ceiling fan inside a damp area, such as the bathroom or outdoors, you will need to find one that meets UL's wet/damp rating. A damp rating means the fan can be used in areas with excessive moisture, but covered, such as on a covered patio or in a bathroom. A wet rating means the fan can withstand direct rain, snow or excessive moisture as in an open gazebo.   Tip: While an outdoor fan can be used indoors, an indoor ceiling fan should only be hung inside your home.   ## Ceiling Fan Sizes  !A ceiling fan with glass light kit attached to a downrod.  Because the ceiling fan's main purpose is to circulate air and regulate the temperature in a room, it's important that your fan size matches your room size.   When deciding between ceiling fan sizes, measure the room before you purchase your ceiling fan to ensure you get the size that will be most effective for the space. Measure from floor to ceiling to determine mount type (flush, downrod, standard) for the intended location.   For any room larger than this, consider using two fans to move air around the room.  For guest bedrooms and bathrooms, small ceiling fans work well whereas larger spaces, like a great room, will benefit the most from large ceiling fans.   Recommended fan width based on the length of the longest wall in your room:}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Best Ceiling Fans for Your Home (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{* Length of longest wall is less than 12 feet, your fan width or blade span should be 46 inches or less. * Length of longest wall is 12 to 18 feet, your fan width or blade span should be 48 to 56 inches. * Length of longest wall is more than 18 feet, your fan width or blade span should be 56 inches or more.    ## Ceiling Fan Mounting Type  !A chart showing a downrod length selector.  Measure your ceiling height to choose the correct downrod length. Subtract 12 inches from the downrod length if your ceiling fan includes a light kit.  In addition to ceiling fan sizes, the mounting type you choose is extremely important. Here’s how to find the best mounting type for your room.  When choosing your fan, you will come across the terms \"downrod\" and \"flush.\" Pay close attention to your ceiling height so you can determine which mounting option you need.   Ideally, your ceiling fan height (from floor to blade) should be 8 feet. Fans mounted too close to the ceiling will trap or move less air around the space.   * Flush mount: Mounted to the ceiling, this option is ideal for rooms with low ceilings. * Downrod mount: The best ceiling fans for living rooms or rooms with a ceiling height greater than 8 feet typically include a downrod. Very high ceilings, such as a vaulted ceiling, may need a longer downrod, so check the downrod size prior to purchasing your fan.    If you have a tall, vaulted or sloped ceiling, hang your ceiling fan from a downrod to lower it to the desired 8 or 9 feet from the floor. If your ceiling is sloped, check that the ceiling fan you are buying can be installed at an angle. If not, a sloped-ceiling mounting kit may be required.  Tip: When possible, hang the fan in the middle of the room and allow at least 18 inches between fan blades and the walls.   ## The Best Ceiling Fan Styles  !A modern ceiling fan installed on a white ceiling.  With so many types of ceiling fans available, blades are offered in a variety of finishes, including natural, white, oak, black and more. Some blades will offer a reversible finish.   Light shades are usually glass, either frosted or not. Ceiling fans themselves also come in a variety of finishes, and it's best to try to match the tone to the other finishes in your room/home.  If your cabinet knobs are oil-rubbed bronze, choose a fan with a complementary finish. If possible, try to match your ceiling fan style and finish to your home's decor (flooring, paint and furniture colors and style). For example, a}}<|eot_id|>"}

Tropical-inspired ceiling fans featuring bamboo, rattan blades and leaf-inspired designs complement beach homes and cottage-style houses. * Modern: A contemporary style ceiling fan with clean lines and metallic finishes are ideal for this style home. Look for fans with a brushed nickel, satin nickel, matte black or chrome finish, as well as fans with a sleek blade design that are right at home in a loft, industrial or mid-century modern space. * Cottage: Classic white ceiling fans capture cottage style best. If this is the style of your home, look for a ceiling fan that's all-white, including hardware, or features nickel hardware. * Traditional: Classic dark wood blades, like oak or walnut, paired with oil-rubbed bronze or brushed nickel finishes and a timeless downlight or bowl kit will blend in perfectly with a traditional-style room. * Farmhouse: Natural wood tones, inspired from the great outdoors, mixed with bronze or matte black hardware complement this home decor style. Look for a ceiling fan that uses Edison-style bulbs for more farmhouse appeal.    ## Ceiling Fan Features  !A collection of various ceiling fans.  There are certain features to keep in mind when you're shopping for a new ceiling fan. Do you need a remote control? Or are you just looking for a simple, small ceiling fan with a pull chain? How you control your ceiling fan's speed and lighting depends on the accessories included. Here are some common control options to consider:   * Pull chain: A standard ceiling fans will include pull chain controls that allow you to adjust fan speed and lighting. This easy-to-reach control is ideal for areas with low ceilings or in rooms that aren't used often. * Remote control: The best ceiling fans for high ceilings will likely include a remote control. Handheld and convenient, ceiling fan remotes are lightweight and portable, allowing the fan to be operated within a 30 to 45-foot range. * Wall control: This option allows you to control the fan by pressing a button. It is like a remote but is secured to the wall in place of a switch. * Smart ceiling fans: Fan and light settings can be controlled with an app on your smart phone or device.    ## Ceiling Fan Lighting  !An outdoor ceiling fan installed on a patio.  The majority of}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Best Ceiling Fans for Your Home (part 4)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{ceiling fans come with a light kit; however, if you are hanging the fan in an area with good natural lighting or already-installed lighting, buying ceiling fans without lights is perfectly fine. If you do choose a ceiling fan with lights, you will need to decide between these types of lighting output.   * LED bulb: Consumes the least amount of energy; has an average lifespan of 50,000 hours. Bulbs can be switched out quickly for replacement or to change bulb style or color temperature. * Integrated LED light kit: LED bulbs are built into the fan. They last a decade or more with regular use. In many modules, the LED light kit can be replaced or repaired at the end of its life by contacting the manufacturer for the replace part or unit.    Tip: Remember to match your light fixture and bulb style to your home decor, if you can.   ## Airflow and Efficiency  !A ceiling fan installed close to the ceiling in a living room.  A fan motor determines its efficiency and airflow. Airflow efficiency is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air being moved. Fans either come with a DC motor or an AC motor. DC motors tend to produce less heat and consume less energy than heavier AC motors. Fans with high CFM, or airflow efficiency, are perfect for outdoor spaces or garages because they will circulate more air and can help keep away insects and pests.   If energy-efficiency is at the top of your must-have list, look for an Energy Star rated fan. These certified ceiling fans use up to 20 percent less energy. Energy Star-certified ceiling fans can help reduce your heating and cooling costs.  It's important to note that dirty fan blades will not have a high airflow efficiency, so be sure to dust your ceiling fans often.   Tip: In the summer, run your fan counterclockwise for a cool breeze. In the winter, run your fan clockwise to push down warm air circulating near the ceiling to better distribute the heat throughout the room.

{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Best Engineered Wood Flooring for Your Home (part 1)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{!thumbnail  Published October 20, 2023  Engineered hardwood flooring gives you the look of solid hardwood floors without the high maintenance needs. There are many styles and types of engineered wood floors, so you can easily find one that works for your home. When making your flooring selection, you should consider the installation methods, types of wood materials and additional features like scratch- and UV-resistance.    Use this guide to find out what engineered wood flooring is, its benefits and how to choose the best engineered wood flooring for your home.  ## Table of Contents  1. 1  What is Engineered Wood?  2. 2  Engineered Wood vs. Solid Hardwood  3. 3  Engineered Wood vs. Laminate  4. 4  Benefits of Engineered Wood Flooring  5. 5  Types of Engineered Wood Floors  6. 6  Engineered Wood Flooring Materials     See More  ## What is Engineered Wood?  !A modern style living room with thin engineered wood plank flooring.  Engineered wood is a manmade wood product created using wood strands, particles, fibers or veneers of wood forged together with adhesives. In the case of engineered hardwood flooring, each flooring plank is composed of several layers of plywood or fiberboard with a solid wood veneer on top. The top wood veneer gives the planks the appearance of solid hardwood, while the plywood or fiberboard core adds sturdiness and durability.  ## Engineered Wood vs. Solid Hardwood  !Alt Text Here  Solid hardwood flooring planks are made entirely from a single piece of hardwood. Engineered wood flooring planks, by contrast, are made up of several layers of composite wood, with a thin veneer of solid hardwood on top. Both are great flooring options, depending on your needs.    Because its entire thickness is high quality wood, solid hardwood flooring can be sanded down and refinished many times. This ability gives it a much longer lifespan than engineered wood floors. With the right installation and care, solid hardwood can last a literal lifetime, anywhere from 30 to 100 years. However, solid hardwood is prone to warping from temperature and moisture changes, so it should only be installed above-grade. Wider solid hardwood planks may also need to be glued and nailed down to a wood subfloor to prevent movement.    Engineered wood flooring can also be refinished if it has a thick hardwood veneer. Thinner veneers typically can’t be refinished, so the flooring only has a lifespan of up to 30 years. Thick veneers can help engineered wood flooring last up}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Best Engineered Wood Flooring for Your Home (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{to 80 years. Engineered wood planks are also sturdier and less likely to warp over time, so they can be installed below-grade and over wood or concrete subfloors.    When it comes to cost, solid hardwood is typically more expensive per square foot than engineered hardwood. Higher quality engineered hardwood can get as expensive as a mid- to upper-range solid hardwood, but the labor for installing either type of flooring is usually the same and makes up the bulk of the cost.   Tip: Both engineered and solid hardwood floors can make a home more appealing to future buyers and add resale value.   ## Engineered Wood vs. Laminate  !Alt Text Here  Engineered wood flooring is sometimes confused for laminate flooring. However, laminate flooring consists of a synthetic veneer over a particleboard core. Its veneer is printed to resemble wood but is not actually wood. Laminate flooring has a shorter lifespan than either engineered or solid hardwood, lasting between 15 to 25 years or sometimes longer with proper care. Some people choose laminate over wood flooring because of its low cost per square foot and superior resistance to daily wear and tear.    ## Benefits of Engineered Wood Flooring  !Alt Text Here  The best engineered wood flooring for your home should offer all the following benefits:  * Attractive appearance: To the untrained eye, engineered wood is indistinguishable from solid hardwood. Plus, engineered wood flooring typically is available in a vast variety of colors, textures and sizes. * Durable: Engineered wood flooring has a stable construction that withstands natural temperature and moisture changes. Most types can be refinished at least once if they get too damaged. * Light-resistant: Most types of engineered wood floors are UV-resistant, so they won’t fade from the sun. * Mold-resistant: While not all types of engineered wood floors are fully waterproof, engineered wood is more waterproof than other flooring materials. Not only does it resist warping and water damage, it also resists mold growth. * Easy to maintain: Engineered wood floors are easy to clean and are usually pre-finished with a protective coating that doesn’t require additional coats of finish or shine. * Multiple installation options: Unlike solid hardwood, engineered wood floors can be installed below-grade, over concrete subfloors and heated floors. They can also be installed with multiple different methods, which are covered in the next section. * Lower cost: Engineered wood}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Best Engineered Wood Flooring for Your Home (part 3)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{flooring is slightly more budget friendly per square foot than solid hardwood, while still looking like solid hardwood.    ## Types of Engineered Wood Floors  !Alt Text Here  Engineered wood flooring is categorized by its installation method. There are three main types of installation methods:  * The adhesive installation method requires the planks to be glued onto the subfloor. This method is used to install engineered wood flooring over a concrete subfloor, especially when below-grade, such as in a basement. * The nail down installation method involves nailing through the planks into a wood subfloor. This method can’t be used on concrete subfloors and is only intended for wood subfloors. * The click lock installation method creates a floating floor by “clicking” the tongue-and-groove planks together. No adhesive or nails are required, as the flooring simply rests over a subfloor, held down by its own weight. This method works for either wood or concrete subfloors and has the added benefit of allowing you to easily pull up the flooring as needed for repairs or replacement.    ## Engineered Wood Flooring Materials  !Alt Text Here  There’s a wide variety of hardwoods that are used to create the top veneer of engineered wood flooring. Each type of hardwood has its own benefits and unique characteristics. Below are the most popular hardwoods used in engineered wood floors:  * Oak: A readily available wood, oak is a commonly used material in engineered wood flooring. Oak is a light-colored wood that has varying undertones. Red oak has pink undertones, white oak has yellow and gold undertones and French oak has gray undertones. White and French oak are both slightly tougher than red oak, which is more prone to scratches. * Hickory: An extremely hard and durable wood, hickory is another very popular choice for flooring. It’s more durable than oak, making it a good choice for rooms with heavy traffic. Hickory is a light- to medium-toned wood with contrasting stripes in its natural pattern. * Maple: Maple has an even texture and pattern, which makes it a good choice for sleek, stained floors. It’s naturally light-toned but can be stained a wide variety of colors. Note that if you don’t want to stain and finish a floor yourself, most engineered wood floors come pre-stained and finished from a manufacturer. Maple is tougher than oak, but not quite as tough as hickory. * Birch: Like oak, birch wood also comes in multiple varieties—yellow birch and red birch. Both}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Best Engineered Wood Flooring for Your Home (part 4)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{varieties are equally as strong and are both more durable than oak. Birch is a good choice for rooms with medium to heavy foot traffic. * Bamboo: While not technically wood, bamboo makes an excellent flooring material that has the look and texture of real wood. Its strength and durability can vary between manufacturers, but it’s typically more durable than the hardwoods in this list. Bamboo flooring can be refinished, stained and installed just like any other engineered wood flooring. Plus, bamboo is an eco-friendly renewable resource.    Many more hardwood species are available, but keep in mind that exotic wood species often require more upfront investment than other types. Also note that any type of wood can be stained a different color to fit your style.   ## Plank Thickness & Width  !Alt Text Here  Another aspect to consider when choosing engineered wood flooring is the size of the planks. The thickness of the planks will affect the durability and longevity of the floor. The width of the planks affects only the floor’s appearance.   Thickness: Look for engineered wood flooring with a veneer that is at least 3 millimeters thick. Anything thinner can’t be sanded or refinished. Most veneers range between 3 to 7mm thick. Some high-quality engineered hardwoods have veneers thicker than 7mm. The total thickness of the planks can be thin, medium or thick:  * Thin: 1/4-inch thick * Medium: 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch thick * Thick: Over 3/4-inch thick    Width: Choose the width of the planks based on your preferences, budget and home’s style. Narrower planks tend to be less expensive and are more common in traditional homes. Wider planks are typically more expensive and look more luxurious. They’re a natural fit for modern homes.  * Narrow: 5 inches wide or less * Medium: 5 inches to 7 inches wide * Wide: Over 7 inches wide    ## What to Look for When Choosing Engineered Wood Flooring  !Alt Text Here  To find the best engineered wood flooring for your home, you should also consider the flooring’s finishes, color, texture and any extra features it can offer.    Finishes and Features:   * Scratch resistant: The finish helps prevent scratches and scuffs from foot traffic, pets and moving furniture. Similarly, you can find engineered hardwood floors that are dent resistant. * UV resistant: The finish blocks UV rays from sunlight so the wood color won’t fade. * Waterproof: Protect against damage from spills with waterproof or water resistant flooring. * Stainable:}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Best Engineered Wood Flooring for Your Home (part 5)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{Stainable floors allow you to refresh or change the color in the future. * Supports refinishing: If you want the flooring to last a long time, find engineered hardwood that can be refinished if it gets damaged or worn-looking.    Underlayment:   * Find out if the engineered wood flooring requires an underlayment for installation. Underlayment is a thin material placed between the flooring and the subfloor. It helps absorb noise, adds insulation and protects both the flooring and subfloor from water damage. It also helps correct uneven subfloors. Most wood flooring requires an underlayment, but some engineered wood floors have an attached underlayment.    Color:   * To choose the color of your engineered hardwood flooring, decide whether you want light, medium or dark toned wood. * Light engineered wood flooring: Light tones brighten rooms and have an airy and open aesthetic. They’re great for minimalist and coastal styles but may show dirt more easily. * Medium engineered wood flooring: These traditional wood tones match most home decor styles. Medium toned wood floors are the most popular choice with the widest selection of flooring. They can have warm or cool undertones. * Dark engineered wood flooring: These luxurious wood tones can make rooms feel cozy and welcoming. Dark floors are great for many styles of homes from modern to traditional. Dark wood can include cool, nearly black tones or warm red tones. * Alternatively, narrow down your choice by searching for specific color families: brown, red, gray, tan, white, black are some examples.    Texture:   * Textured engineered wood flooring already has dents, scuffs and simulated damage of varying degrees on the plank surface. There’s less need to worry about actual damage from daily wear and tear. Plus, textured flooring will need less maintenance than non-textured flooring. Note that if you resurface textured floors, you’ll lose some of its initial texture.    Whether you want smooth or textured floors is based entirely on your design preference and ability to clean and maintain the floors.  * Smooth: Smooth floors have a sleek and shiny finish that shows a wood pattern without the surface texture. This is a popular choice in many modern homes. Smooth flooring may dent and scuff more easily than textured flooring. * Distressed: This texture mimics the appearance of older wood and adds an air of history and lived-in comfort. Distressed floors better hides scuffs and dents. Since it looks like reclaimed}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Best Engineered Wood Flooring for Your Home (part 6)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{wood, this texture is a great option for rustic, industrial or traditional homes. * Wire brushed: Wire brushed engineered wood adds subtle texture for an elegant, solid hardwood appearance. It blends in perfectly with most styles of homes. * Hand scraped: Hand scraped engineered wood has a stronger texture than wire brushed. Hand scraping is usually one aspect of distressed engineered wood floors, since it adds an antiqued appearance. The texture’s irregularity makes the wood look more convincing as solid hardwood. This is a great texture choice for historical, traditional or rustic homes.    ## Engineered Wood Flooring Maintenance  !Alt Text Here  Once you’ve found the best engineered wood flooring for your home, it’s important to know how to take care of it. Here are some tips for maintaining engineered wood floors:  * Sweep regularly to remove dust, dirt, pet hair and other debris. You can use a vacuum so long as the vacuum doesn’t have a beater bar or has a “bare floor” setting. Otherwise, the vacuum may scuff the floor. * Mop as needed or whenever the floors begin to look dull. Use a mop that’s damp, but not soaking wet to avoid water damage. Use a soft towel to dry any spots that are still wet a few minutes after mopping. * Clean up spills and any water on the floor as soon as possible. * For deep cleanings, use a cleaner that's safe for engineered wood flooring. Follow the cleaner’s manufacturer’s instructions for the best results. * Don’t use cleaning products with ammonia, wax or oil. * Use only soft materials like a towel or microfiber cleaning cloth when applying cleaner to your floor. * Minimize the appearance of scratches and prevent more damage using a scratch concealer made for engineered wood flooring. * Consider putting rugs, mats or felt furniture sliders underneath chairs or other frequently used furniture to prevent scuffs and scratches on your floor.    Engineered wood flooring has an ideal balance of beauty and resilience. It’s easier to install and maintain than solid hardwood flooring and longer lasting than laminate flooring. Plus, engineered wood floors come in so many styles, colors and textures that it can suit nearly any room in your home.

First start your room makeover journey by crafting a vision board. Take a moment to analyze the current state of your room and think about the colors, designs, and overall aesthetic that you desire for your space.  For me, creating a moodboard outlining the direction I wanted my room transformation to go in was the key in my success on this project.  ## Prep + Painting  !A person painting  Preparation is key to a successful room makeover. Begin by protecting your floors with plastic tarps to guard against any accidental paint spills. Then, choose a color that resonates with your vision.  I opted for Glidden’s Veil of Dusk, a hue with khaki and green/yellow undertones, and it was perfect for complementing my earthy theme.  Once prepped, paint your walls to set the foundation for your makeover.  ## Calculating Measurements + Making Cuts  !A person sawing trim pieces to size  Measure twice, cut once! When planning your box trim designs, precision is key. Begin by measuring the length of each wall and calculating the dimensions for your box trim.  Consider factors like spacing and preferred height for each box trim element. For instance, I aimed for a 5-inch spacing gap from walls and baseboards, with a desired lower box trim height of 20 inches.  Using these preferences, I calculated the height of the upper box trim by subtracting the total spacing gaps from the ceiling height, minus the height}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: DIY Wall Paneling + Room Refresh (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{of the lower box trim. This gave me a height of 68 inches for each piece. To calculate the width, subtract the total wall width from the number of spacing gaps, then divide by the desired number of box trim designs.  For example, on my 98-inch-wide wall, I wanted two box trim designs. So, subtracting 15 inches for gaps, I divided the remaining 83 inches by two, resulting in 41.5 inches for each box trim width. Apply these width calculations consistently across all walls for uniformity.  ## Installing the Box Trim Design  !A person putting up trim on the wall  With your measurements and cuts ready, it's time to install the box trim. I began by using a 5\" spacer block and leveler to ensure even spacing and alignment. I then secured each piece to the wall using my Makita 18-Gauge Cordless Brad Nailer and 1.75\" brad nails. Work your way up from the bottom panel, using your spacer, level and brad nail gun throughout the entirety. Take your time to ensure each piece is perfectly positioned and leveled before nailing each piece!  ## Adding the Final Touches  !A decorated corner of the room  With the box trim accent wall in place, it's time to add the finishing touches that will bring your vision to life. Handpick decor items that complement your chosen color scheme and style. From moss green velvet curtains to a mid-century modern side table, each piece should enhance the overall aesthetic of the room. Consider adding elements like this jute area rug, artificial olive tree, end-of-bed bench, and textured lamp to create an inviting and cohesive space.  ## The Final Reveal  !The completed space  Step back and admire your handiwork! Thanks to Home Depot's curated products and decor items along with some DIY skills, this room has undergone a stunning transformation, and yours can as well. Embrace the minimal yet chic design of a box trim accent wall and inspire others to tackle their own room makeovers with confidence.  * * *  This post was created in partnership with The Home Depot.

Now, her main goal is to inspire and encourage others to DIY. She believes there is potential in everyone, and wants to show that it is possible to any project, whether simple or complex, in their homes.  #### A Note From The Home Depot  After renovating her kitchen ten years ago, Sara Syrett of Twelve on Main thought the dark backsplash and alder wood cabinets weighed the room down. Despite a tight budget and little help, Sara completed this cozy DIY farmhouse kitchen remodel to turn the room into the kitchen of her dreams in only two weeks.  Throughout her new kitchen, look for mixed metal appliances and hardware, an affordable subway-style backsplash and open shelving that tie this farmhouse look together.   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Kitchen Remodel Checklist  2. 2  Removing the Current Backsplash  3. 3  Installing the New Tile Backsplash  4. 4  Painting the Cabinet Doors  5. 5  Mixed Metal Hardware and Appliances  6. 6  The Completed Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel     !DIY Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel  I am going to show you how I updated my kitchen, on a small budget by carefully choosing items and projects that would give the biggest bang for my buck.  If you find yourself wanting to give your kitchen an update, but feel that you cannot or don’t want to commit to spending thousands of dollars to do it, then I have some advice for you. There are key elements that will completely transform your space. Choose your battles.  The most obvious update would be kitchen cabinets. But there are a few other more inexpensive things that you can do to create a lovely space. Think outside the box here. Do you have a backsplash? I did, and I did not like it. So, that was on my list.  ## Kitchen Remodel Checklist  * Paint Cabinets * Add or change current backsplash * Add new hardware to current cabinets * Update lighting * Change out kitchen sink faucet * Do space planning, add or take away cabinets if needed. (This will completely change the space). * New countertops    Now, most of us cannot do all of these things. Neither could I, nor did I want to. I still loved so many things about my kitchen. I loved my countertops, so they were staying. I hated my backsplash, so it was going bye bye.  Here is what I chose to}}<|eot_id|>"}

After deciding what projects I wanted to tackle, I made a supply list.  ## Removing the Current Backsplash  !DIY Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel  !DIY Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel  The first thing I did was tackle the backsplash. I had to remove the current tile, and with careful methods, I was able to save the majority of the drywall behind it.  ## Installing the New Tile Backsplash  !DIY Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel  I chose to replace it with a 4 x 4 square in. white tile with a brick or subway tile pattern.  I took the tile all the way to the ceiling. I think this attention to detail makes a big difference between having a standard look and a more custom look.  Above, you see it mid-project.  As someone who loves subway tile, this was a big decision for me. I love the fact that this tile was super inexpensive and by using a “fancy” pattern, it completely changes the feel of the tile. I chose Delorean Grey grout to compliment the tile.  ## Painting the Cabinet Doors  !DIY Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel  My cabinets were the next thing I tackled. When deciding what color to paint them, take into consideration all the other aspects in the room such as tile, countertop colors, light fixtures, and cabinet pulls. Don’t work against it all, work with it.  I chose Behr MARQUEE White paint for the wall cabinets . For the island, I decided to change it up and go with a real dark navy blue color, called Winter Way. I loved the way it looked with my grey island countertop and it surprisingly went really nice with the black countertops on the wall cabinets.  I removed all the cabinet doors, cleaned, sanded and de-glossed them, and then painted them all in my garage with a foam brush roller. I was going to spray them, but MARQUEE brand recommends not using an air powered sprayer, which is what I have.  The colors went great with my current cabinet pulls. I debated whether I should get new ones, but sometimes, by picking the correct colors, it can completely change the look of them. That’s exactly what happened here. I thought they looked too outdated and rustic for the space, but against the white and blue, the copper undertone stood out. This is where the next choice came into play.  ## Mixed Metal Hardware}}<|eot_id|>"}

The shape is so timeless and classic. I love that the bridge style faucets are really popular right now.  !DIY Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel  Now, I mentioned that I was going to take two cabinets down. I really wanted some open shelving. After all, that is what farmhouse style is all about. I decided to remove the cabinets on either sides of my range. And I know what you are saying, of course the kitchen will look good with a range like that. Well, this was my big splurge when we built our home. I knew that if I didn’t do it then, I would never do it, and so I designed the space around it. So, yes, I did have some great bones to start with.  By doing a little space planning and organizing, I was able to take two cabinets down without losing any storage space. One cabinet held my spices, and the other held our microwave. Both were simple to rehome.  Once the tile was installed and grouted, we installed the shelves. We created brackets with the 2 x 2 in. wood boards. We made sure to install them with drywall anchors and used a masonry drill bit to drill through the tile without breaking it.  I painted the brackets white and stained the shelves.  Once the shelves were in, I had the ultimate pleasure of displaying all those lovely pieces that have been hiding away in cabinets.  ## The Completed Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel  !DIY Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel  !DIY Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel  This project took me two weeks to complete. And I like to think that the results are pretty spot on with what I wanted.  !DIY Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel!DIY Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel  I have to give myself a little pat on the back, since I told my hubby he did not need to help me, since I am the crazy one that wanted to do the farmhouse kitchen remodel. And other than one very hard to reach area, I, my little old self, did it all. So, if you think you are not good enough to do it, think again. If you put your mind to it, you can. I am proof. I am so completely thrilled with the results!

Last updated February 18, 2025  #### A Note From The Home Depot  From bathrooms to basements, updating the floors in your home is a big project that can transform any space. Depending on your home's age and the flooring type you need to remove and install, this DIY project will take a few weekends to complete. But whether you rent or purchase the tools and equipment, it won’t break your budget. Follow our quick tips for DIY flooring removal and installation.  RENT FLOOR REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION EQUIPMENT   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Flooring Removal 101  2. 2  Step 1: Safety  3. 3  Step 2: Clear the Area and Prep the Room  4. 4  Step 3: Removing Flooring  5. 5  Step 4: Remove Adhesive and Mortar  6. 6  Install Flooring with Rental Equipment     ## Flooring Removal 101  !A flooring professional and a customer reviewing a project plan.    Flooring removal can be a tough job. But The Home Depot’s one-stop shop can cover everything you need, like rental tools and equipment, materials and flooring.  ## Step 1: Safety  !A man wearing a safety mask removing old carpeting.  The first step in a flooring removal project is to assess the safety of the flooring you’re pulling up. If you’re remodeling an older fixer-upper that had vinyl or linoleum flooring installed prior to 1980, it may contain asbestos. In this case, you’ll need to contact a local asbestos abatement officer to test the flooring. Flooring that is contaminated with asbestos is best left to the professionals.  ## Step 2: Clear the Area and Prep the Room  !A person removing a baseboard from a wall with a trim puller.   Next, empty the room of furniture and appliances. If you’re removing the flooring in a kitchen or bathroom, turn off water supplies. You should also remove all appliances, like refrigerators, ovens, pedestal sinks, vanities and toilets.  Once the room is empty, carefully remove the baseboards from the wall with a trim puller. You may prefer to use a prybar and rubber mallet. Little by little, work the trim free from the wall. If you plan to reuse the trim, mark the back with its location in the room. You can then reinstall it after your new flooring installation.  ## Step 3: Removing Flooring  !Pipes, baseboards and other materials on top of removed flooring.  Every type of flooring removal is different. Here’s how to tackle your project, whether you have laminate, tile or carpet.  Laminate:  * Start in the middle of the room when}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Flooring Removal and Installation Tips (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{removing laminate flooring. * Use a utility knife to cut down the middle of the flooring. * Make secondary cuts in strips, 12 inches parallel to the first cut. * Gently lift one end of the flooring and roll the strips up for disposal. * Use a prybar to help lift stuck flooring.    Note: If you want to finish the job even faster, consider a floor stripper rental. A pro flooring stripper can remove large amounts of laminate or vinyl flooring at one time.  Tile: Removing tile takes a bit more heavy-duty demo work. However, you can break up the tile as you go. Use a combination of a breaker and hammer cart for large areas. For tight spots, you can use a demo hammer rental.  Carpet: Removing carpet is the easiest flooring to strip.  * Pick a corner and use a strong set of pliers to pull it from the tack strip. * Continue pulling the carpet, cutting it into long strips. Then, roll it up and haul it away. * Continue the same process for the padding underneath. * Don’t forget to pull up the tack strips around the border of the room once you’re finished.    ## Step 4: Remove Adhesive and Mortar  !A person using a floor maintainer on a subfloor.  If you tackle flooring removal with laminate or tile, you may find residual adhesive and mortar left over on the subfloor. Depending on the subfloor type underneath, a floor stripper or floor maintainer with the proper attachment can make quick work of the task.  ## Install Flooring with Rental Equipment  !A THD representative and customer reviewing a flooring equipment order.  A new flooring installation can transform any space. Depending on the room size, this DIY project may take a weekend, or a few weeks to complete. You won't break your budget when purchasing the new flooring and materials.  Even better, The Home Depot carries the rental installation equipment you need, like floor strippers and attachments. But be sure to always consult the operations manual before using your rental equipment.  If you’re installing tile, rent tile saws to make fast and easy cuts. Similarly, our laminate cutter is ideal for cutting laminate planks to the perfect size and a tile roller is perfect for ensuring a tight fit. Installing hardwoods is also easy with rentals, like floor staplers and floor nailers. From new laminate to tile and hardwood, The Home Depot is your one-stop shop for materials and rental equipment.  * * *  This post was created in partnership with The Home Depot.

I also incorporated black velvet armchairs\") and a stunning marble side table to introduce natural materials into the space. The mix of textures—soft velvet, sleek marble and warm wood—added depth and sophistication.  ## A Total Flooring Transformation  !The corner of the space with the curtains closed.  The biggest game-changer? New flooring. The old, outdated floors needed a serious facelift, so I installed click-lock LVP flooring. As a beginner DIY’er, I was thrilled at how easy the process was! The result? A polished foundation that tied everything together.  ## The Home Depot: The One-Stop Shop for Transformation  !A person sitting on a couch.  From couches to cabinetry, bar essentials to lighting, furniture to flooring, accents to bulbs, The Home Depot had everything I needed to bring my speakeasy vision to life.

However, because it forms a slight depression around the tiles, mold, mildew and dirt can collect in grout. Learn how to clean grout effectively to help make your tile walls or floors look almost new again.   Difficulty:  Beginner  Duration:  Under 2 hours   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Apply Grout Cleaner  2. 2  Scrub and Rinse Grout  3. 3  How to Clean Grout with Stubborn Stains  4. 4  Prevent Buildup on Grout  5. 5  DIY Grout Cleaner     ## Apply Grout Cleaner  !Someone using a scrubber to clean grout on a tiled wall.  * Wear gloves to protect your hands when cleaning grout and tile. * Clean grout with a commercial grout and tile cleaner. Apply it to the dirty areas of the grout following the manufacturer's instructions. * If you prefer cleaning grout with a DIY mixture, make a paste of 3/4-cup baking soda, 1/4-cup hydrogen peroxide and 1 tablespoon of mild dish soap. Apply the paste to the grout with a grout brush and scrub the grout. Grout brushes have compact heads and dense, firm bristles to help loosen the grime that builds up in the grooves. * Do not use acidic cleaners as they may dissolve or pit the grout. Do not use waxy or oil-based cleaners as these can leave a film that will attract dirt and make future cleaning more difficult. * Chlorine bleach may be used on white grout but will leach color out of tinted grout. Oxygen bleach is a better choice for preserving colored grout between tiles.    ## Scrub and Rinse Grout  !Someone using a cloth to clean grout on a tiled floor.  Use a sponge, cleaning rags or microfiber cloths to rinse and wipe each area after cleaning. Be sure no residue is left from the grout cleaner. If you are cleaning grout and tiles on a floor, mop the entire floor when finished.  ## How to Clean Grout with Stubborn Stains  !Someone using a steam cleaner to clean grout on a tiled floor.  Give old or stubborn stains extra attention.  * For stains that regular cleaning can't remove, thoroughly mix 2 tablespoons of oxygenated bleach into 2 cups of warm water. Test the solution on a hidden area of grout to be sure it won’t discolor. * Pour the solution over a small area of stained grout lines. It's best to work in small sections and make more solution as needed. * Allow the cleaner to sit for up to 15 minutes to give the ingredients time}}<|eot_id|>"}

Use firm pressure and make several passes over each grout line. * Assemble and load the steam cleaner according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Use only water. Do not add additional chemicals or cleaning solutions to the cleaner’s water tank. * Once the machine has heated up, turn on the steam function and apply the cleaning brush to the dirty areas of grout. * Use a rag or mop to thoroughly dry up the residual water after steam cleaning. * Steam cleaning can remove grout sealant along with dirt and mildew. After the tile has completely dried, apply grout sealer to protect the surface and prevent future stains.    ## Prevent Buildup on Grout  !Someone cleaning grout on a tiled floor with a sponge.  Clean grout regularly to prevent buildup of dirt and mold or mildew. Each week, pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a cloth and wipe down the dirty grout and tiles. This kills mold and mildew spores and help keeps the tile and grout clean.  ## DIY Grout Cleaner  !Baking soda and other ingredients placed on a countertop.  Make your own grout cleaner. Most, if not all, of the ingredients you’ll probably find right in your cabinets. Here’s a few DIY grout cleaners you can try:  * Make a spreadable paste with 3/4 cup baking soda with 1/4 cup hydrogen peroxide and 1 tablespoon of mild dish soap. Add more baking soda or peroxide if the mixture is too runny or thick. * Put about two teaspoons of cream of tartar in a bowl. Add enough lemon juice to make a thick paste. Fill a spray bottle with hydrogen peroxide and spray the grout first before applying paste. * Mix equal amounts of plain water and baking soda to form a paste. Fill a spray bottle with hydrogen peroxide and spray the grout first before applying this paste.    Once you’ve made your DIY grout cleaner paste, apply it to your grout. For best results, wait a few minutes before scrubbing with a grout brush or old toothbrush. Rinse. Repeat if necessary.  Keeping your grout free of stains and mildew is an important part of taking care of your tile. There are several ways to clean grout, and you can even make your own DIY grout cleaner. Now that you know how to clean your grout, make sure to maintain the look with regular cleaning. Anytime the stains are highly resistant to cleaning, use a portable steam cleaner. If you don't own one, you can a rent a portable steam cleaner from The Home Depot.  ## Related Products  See More  ## Related}}<|eot_id|>"}

The smallest section of any room needs just a little bit of creative thinking to make it functional. Even just rearranging furniture can change the entire look and feel of a room. This guide will give you tips and ideas to help you create a cozy nook in your house, so you can unwind, read books and create an escape without having to leave home.   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Select the Location  2. 2  Define the Space  3. 3  Add in Seating  4. 4  Bring in a Bookshelf  5. 5  Add in Details  6. 6  Pile on Extras     See More  ## Select the Location  !A corner with just a houseplant on a stand.   While this will work for any area or room in your home, one of our favorite transformations is turning an unused corner into a reading nook. It’s super satisfying to give any room a fresh perspective while also creating a little space for yourself – bonus points if the corner is near a window for natural light to read by.  Choose a spot in the house where you can create a relaxing vibe. If your home is often busy, filled with family, or your space acts as your office during the week, carving out a little corner for yourself can help you unwind.   ## Define the Space  !A natural fiber rug being laid down on the floor.   Because this cozy nook is being set up in a corner of a room, you want to make sure to define the space. Laying down a rug in whatever style you prefer will not only create definition but will warm up the nook, keeping your feet comfy and providing support for furniture.  Tip: Don’t be afraid to pull the rug out from the wall a bit – this will make the nook appear like an intentional part of the room’s design.   ## Add in Seating  !An upholstered chair is added to the corner.  Nothing says cozy nook like comfy seating. A good chair can make it even easier to unwind with a book after a long day. Be sure to take the size of your space into account when adding in any seating.   ## Bring in a Bookshelf  !A woman leans a vertical bookshelf against the wall.   Perfect for housing all your favorite books as well as displaying plants, candles and more, a bookshelf can also act as part table if your corner is quaint but small on space. Keep in mind that while any type of bookshelf will work, a vertical shelf will draw the eye up and make the space seem more open.   If you’re looking}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Create a Cozy Nook in Your Home (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{for a new way to organize your books, try arranging them by color, and alternating between traditional vertical placement and horizontal stacks for visual interest. Add decorative objects among the stacks, using heavy objects for bookends, vases and plants for a bit of greenery and leaning frames for natural separation between sections.   ## Add in Details  !A gold floor lamp is added into the corner.   While natural light is always preferred for relaxing spaces, a good light is a must, especially for rainy days or evenings spent in the nook. A sleek floor lamp eliminates the need for a side table and can provide good overhead lighting for reading.   ## Pile on Extras  !A plush leather pouf is placed on top of the rug.  One of the most important elements of the nook: the cozy extras. When it comes to comfy pillows and blankets, pile on the details. This spot is meant to be as warm and inviting as you want it to be, so have fun with the colors and textures of the throws and pillows.   Additionally, a corner often means there's not a lot of space for a couch or spacious seating. Adding in a plush pouf or ottoman can help you kick back and relax when your legs need a little extra stretch.   ## Inspiration  !A refreshed corner with seating, lighting and other cozy extras.  Look for inspiration: The internet is full of inspiration for reading nooks – but you don’t have to limit yourself to just one search term.   * Make a mood board: Save photos of rooms with throw pillows you like, chairs that look comfy and color schemes you want to emulate. Save them all to one folder on your phone or computer so you can create a mood board or look back at them when looking for items to furnish your nook. * Narrow down the items you'll need: Since this is a small space, you don't want to overwhelm the area with too much. * Use what you have: Try moving furniture from another room in the house to this area, and work from there.   Reinvent any corner of your home easily. Whether it's a new area rug or a stylish floor lamp, The Home Depot delivers online orders when and where you need them.​  ## Related Products  ![ottomans](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc7pl)  ### ottomans  ![floor lamps](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc7no)  ### floor lamps  ![bookcases](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc7o5)  ### bookcases  ![chairs](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc7py)  ### chairs  ![area rugs](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZarjg)  ### area rugs  Show More  ##}}<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Create a Flex Space (part 1)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{!A desk, chair and wall shelving are in a small area under the stairs.  Published August 1, 2024  You live in your home every day, but as life changes, sometimes your needs do too. Your home may need to adjust to new circumstances, and that’s where flex spaces come in. A flex space can be a room that’s completely repurposed for your new needs, or it can be a room that functions for multiple purposes. This guide explores how to plan your flex areas, and it gives some inspiration for the types of spaces you may want in your home.  ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Plan for Flexibility  2. 2  Home Office  3. 3  Homework Station  4. 4  Supply Closet  5. 5  Pet Area  6. 6  Reading Nook     See More  ## Plan for Flexibility  !A woman builds a room in the space underneath stairs in a house.  When you want a flex room to be able to change functions easily, look for mobile furniture and small, lightweight pieces. Murphy beds and wheeled desks are some examples. Storage should be available and can be either built-in, in the form of portable containers or furniture that doubles as storage – think storage ottomans and baskets. Paint and décor should complement most colors so it’s easy to repurpose the room at any time.  Flex rooms that will be multifunctional can use shelves or screens to divide it into sections. Consider painting walls or using decor with colors that complement all sections of the room. This will help it look cohesive.  Your flex room can be a spare room in your home, or you may be inspired to build an area. The areas below staircases are a great option for adding space to your home. Next, let’s look at some ideas for flex spaces in your home.  ## Home Office  !A desk and chair in a small, home office area.  A home office makes sense for anyone who owns a business or works from home. A dedicated flex space just needs to feel inspiring and comfortable. Keep it well lit, whether with several lamps or natural lighting, and decorate it for long-term sessions. This may be an area you paint colorfully, even if you plan to use it for other tasks, or you may want it neutral for more options. You’ll need a desk, shelving for binders or other filing systems, a comfortable desk chair and any other essentials for your work. To make it more flexible, consider furniture that is light enough to be easily moved.  ## Homework Station  !A small desk and a yellow chair sit in a small room under a home's stairway.  Whether you have children in grade school or college, or even}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Create a Flex Space (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{if you’re in school yourself, having a dedicated area for homework is a great idea for a small flex space. You’ll need a desk of course, storage for paper and writing instruments, lighting for the desk space, and maybe even a bookshelf. The desk can be a foldout type if you’re tight on space or if you plan to use the room for other things. Homework stations can be tucked into a smaller section of a larger room for a multipurpose room as well. In that case, partitions may be useful to encourage focus.  ## Supply Closet  !A supply closet with two open doors sits underneath a staircase.  Turn your small flex space into a closet for supplies or other things. Hooks and shelves attached to the walls will help keep things organized and maximize vertical space. You can also add storage containers like cube shelves or lightweight drawer sets. Cabinets and storage racks are also excellent additions. Make sure you have enough light so items can be seen easily when you need to access them.  ## Pet Area  !A person watches a dog lying on a dog bed in a room built under the stairs.  A dedicated pet area can make your home more organized and give your pet a much-needed space for their things. This small area can house your pet’s food and water stations. It could also be used for their sleeping and relaxation needs by including their bed, crate or vertical spaces, depending on the type of pet you have. In this case, you may want to have lighting that can be muted to be less stimulating. If the space is big enough, you can also store food, toys, carriers, leashes, collars and other pet-related items. For pets that need to be kept separated from the rest of the home when you leave for a few hours, a pet room may be a solution.  ## Reading Nook  !A lounge chair and ottoman sit in the corner of a room with a full bookshelf and soft lighting.  If you have a lot of books and you love to read, a reading nook could be a dream come true. Outfit this flex space with lots of shelves for your books. You might opt for wall shelving or standalone shelves. Built-in shelving would be a great investment also, even if you plan to use the room for other things. The lighting should be suitable for your reading needs. Some people prefer soft lighting, while others need bright lights. You may want a variety as your eyesight changes. Have a cozy seating area, whether you prefer a couch, daybed or lounge chair with an ottoman. The room can easily convert if any furniture you use is light enough}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Create a Flex Space (part 3)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{to be moved easily.  ## Beverage Station  !A coffee and tea station with a microwave and small refrigerator nearby.  A coffee or tea station is perfect for morning coffee, coffee breaks and tea time. This area could be cozy, with a lounge chair and lamp for enjoying your hot – or iced – beverage. It can also be a well-stocked station off to the side of a larger area. Include storage for filters, bags of coffee, loose and bagged tea selections and anything your household members like to add to their drinks. You may want to make it house a water dispenser or bottled water, or it could even be a minibar for adult beverages. Don’t forget to use lighting that sets whatever mood you want your beverage area to complement.  Flex spaces are a sensible use of extra space in your home. They can be dedicated or temporary, and the possibilities for their use are endless. When you’ve decided on how to create your space, The Home Depot’s Home Organization Services can help you design it perfectly.  ## Related Products  ![Bar Tools](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZcewy)  ### Bar Tools  ![Beverage Dispensers](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZci6h)  ### Beverage Dispensers  ![Drinking Glasses](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc6xf)  ### Drinking Glasses  ![Wine Racks](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZcewq)  ### Wine Racks  ![Paint Colors](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZcaw8)  ### Paint Colors  ![Electric Kettles](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc6bl)  ### Electric Kettles  ![Instant Hot Water Faucets](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZbu2t)  ### Instant Hot Water Faucets  ![Loose Leaf Tea & Iced Tea](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZ2fkony0)  ### Loose Leaf Tea & Iced Tea  ![Tea Bags](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZ2fkony7)  ### Tea Bags  ![Mugs](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZcewp)  ### Mugs  ![Coffee Accessories](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZcf9p)  ### Coffee Accessories  ![Tea Kettles](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc7fo)  ### Tea Kettles  ![Coffee Makers](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZbv4w)  ### Coffee Makers  ![Feeding Supplies](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc537)  ### Feeding Supplies  ![Dog Beds & Pillows](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc4ua)  ### Dog Beds & Pillows  ![Litter Boxes & Houses](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc52m)  ### Litter Boxes & Houses  ![Dog Crates](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc4ti)  ### Dog Crates  ![Dog Pens & Gates](https://www.homedepot.com/b/N-5yc1vZc4uu)  ### Dog}}<|eot_id|>"}

It guarantees waterproof tile floors that will last for many years without cracking or other signs of damage. It may sound complicated, but learning how to install cement board on a floor is possible even if you don’t have years of DIY experience.  This guide will teach you how to install cement board on floors. You'll also learn how to use thin-set mortar to secure and level your subfloor before installing tile.   Difficulty:  Intermediate  Duration:  Over 1 day   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  What is Backer Board?  2. 2  Plan and Mark the Backer Board Placement  3. 3  Spread Mortar  4. 4  Lay the Backer Board Sheets  5. 5  Secure Backer Board with Screws  6. 6  Fill the Joints with Mortar     See More  ## What is Backer Board?  !Alt Text Here  * Cement board, often referred to as backer board, is a thin layer of concrete with fiberglass mesh on both sides. It’s available in sheets of many sizes. Most projects need 3-foot by 5-foot sheets. * Whenever you’re laying tile on a wood subfloor, you need to first install cement backer board. Backer board prevents leaks and water damage that could harm your flooring and the structure of your home. Unlike wood or drywall sub-surfaces, cement backer board will not rot, warp or grow mold and mildew when exposed to water. That’s the main reason they’re a go-to choice for permanent installations like this. * Another reason you’ll need to work with cement backer board is that it’s never safe to install new tiles over existing tiles. You also can’t safely install tile flooring over plywood subfloor or onto an unprotected wood floor. If you did, there'd be a serious risk of rot, water damage, warping and mold. Plus, your tile and grout would likely crack.    ## Plan and Mark the Backer Board Placement  !Alt Text Here  Now you’re ready to begin installing backer board like a pro. The first step is proper planning and placement. Here’s how you can tackle it correctly:   * Plan the placement of the cement backer board sheets. * Lay the sheets so the joints in the backer board don’t line up with the joints in the subfloor. The backer board should completely cover the subfloor joints. Stagger the board placements a bit like bricks. * Do a dry run and lay the backer board down to fully cover the area you plan to tile. * If needed, cut the backer board to fit in small spaces or around obstructions. Score the board}}<|eot_id|>"}

Thin-set dries slowly, allowing you to fix and readjust backer board sheets as needed. The ingredients in thin-set mortar are cement, fine sand and a water retaining agent. It's used to bond ceramic or porcelain tile and cement backer board. * With the smooth side of a 1/4-inch notched trowel, spread enough mortar for one sheet. * Ridge the mortar with the notched side of the trowel. You'll now have parallel lines in your thin-set.    ## Lay the Backer Board Sheets  !Alt Text Here  * While the mortar is still wet, place a sheet of backer board onto it. * Repeat this process, spreading mortar and laying the backer board one sheet at a time. * Leave a 1/4-inch gap between the backer board and the wall. * Leave a 1/8-inch gap between each backer board sheet. The corners and edges of the sheets should not touch one another.    ## Secure Backer Board with Screws  !Alt Text Here  * Drill cement board screws through the backer board sheets every 6 to 8 inches. * Position the screws at least 1/2-inch, but no more than 2 inches, from the edge of the sheet. * Drive the screws in so that the heads are slightly below the surface of the backer board sheet.    ## Fill the Joints with Mortar  !Alt Text Here  * Use the flat side of your notched trowel to fill the joints between the backer board sheets. * Smooth the mortar so it extends about 1 1/2 inches on each side of the joint. The extra mortar will make it easier to embed the fiberglass tape.    ## Cover the Joints with Fiberglass Tape  !Alt Text Here  * Cut the fiberglass seam tape to length with the thin side of your trowel. * Push the tape into the joint mortar. * Once the tape is embedded, scrape off any excess mortar.    ## Cover Fiberglass Tape with Mortar  !Alt Text Here  * Spread a thin layer of mortar over the fiberglass tape with the flat side of your trowel or paint scraper. * Feather the edges of the mortar across each board so the surface is as smooth as possible.    ## Allow Mortar to Set  !Alt Text Here  Although it's tempting to start tiling the floor, let the mortar fully set and dry first. Wait 24 to 48 hours before tiling. The drying time is important for a strong hold.   Fully bonded mortar means your cement board won't flex. This protects your tile}}<|eot_id|>"}

It's key to making your tile floor last as long as possible. It also means that if your grout did crack and water seeped through, your subfloor would be protected by the cement board.  ## Cement Board Tips  !Alt Text Here  Here are a few things to keep in mind when learning how to install cement board.   * Fiber Cement backerboard is used across many different wall and floor projects because it is suitable for shower, countertop, backsplash and floor installations. These include laminate, vinyl and wood. * Backerboard in both water-resistant and waterproof options makes this ideal for renovations in water prone areas. * Installing cement board in a renovation will require that you remove the existing surface material before installing backer board over the studs. * Cement board can also be used on countertops when laying tile. However, the process will involve using an extra sheet of backer board. * Never use standard screws when installing cement board. Standard screws will corrode. Always use cement board screws.    Learning how to install cement board on floors is an important step when you’re preparing to lay tile. Once installed, the backer board will protect wood and plywood subfloors from water damage. It'll also create a smooth, solid foundation for your tile. Ready to get the tools and materials you need?

Laminate can be cut with a hand saw, circular saw or flooring cutter. Plus, most laminate flooring comes in planks that simply snap together with a tongue-and-groove system. This makes for a quick and relatively trouble-free installation process. From how to cut laminate floors to how to lay laminate floors, this guide will cover the basics of how to install laminate flooring in any room of your home.  Difficulty:  Intermediate  Duration:  Over 1 day    ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Gather Tools and Materials  2. 2  Prep Floor  3. 3  Trim Door Jambs  4. 4  Plan Out Design  5. 5  Cut Laminate Flooring  6. 6  Install the Underlayment     See More  ## Gather Tools and Materials  !Laminate flooring placed on the floor with a mallet, t-square and jigsaw.  You can easily lay DIY laminate floors in almost every room in your home. It doesn’t have to be glued down and doesn’t involve grout or mortar. You may not have everything readily available in your garage, so you may want to pay a visit to The Home Depot Rental. Here are the materials and tools needed to install laminate flooring:  * Laminate flooring * Foam underlayment or flooring insulation * Rubber mallet * Circular saw or flooring cutter * Measuring tape * Spacers * Clamps (optional)    Tip: Wear eye protection and ear protection when cutting laminate planks and use knee pads when laying the planks.  ## Prep Floor  !A person uses a demo hammer cart to remove tile flooring.  Before you begin, make sure your subfloor is ready for install. Remove the existing flooring, baseboards and moulding. The base floor should be clean, level and smooth.  * If needed, fix concrete subfloors with a patching compound. For wood subfloors, remove protruding nails and replace any damaged boards. * For slightly uneven floors, use a foam underlayment as the base for your laminate planks. If you determine you need to level the floor, sand the floor and apply a patching compound. * If you are installing the flooring below grade or in a room with high humidity or moisture, install a vapor barrier first.    Tip: If you need to remove existing flooring, consider renting demolition tools like demo hammer carts and breakers, or floor care and refinishing tools like floor strippers and maintainers.  ## Trim Door Jambs  !A man uses a saw to prepare door jambs for new flooring.}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Install Laminate Flooring (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{It’s much easier to cut the trim around doorways than it is to cut the flooring to match the moulding’s irregular shape. Once the door jamb is cut, the flooring will slip under it, leaving a more finished look.  * If needed, take a plank of flooring and a section of the underlayment and lay it finished side down next to the door’s moulding. This will show you how high up you need to cut the moulding. * Trace a guideline along the surface of the moulding with a pencil. * Use a jamb saw to cut along your guideline.    Tip: Use ear protection when sawing.  ## Plan Out Design  !Four types of laminate flooring designs installed in different rooms of a house.  Knowing how to lay laminate flooring starts with choosing a pattern you like, such as herringbone or parquet. Most manufacturers include a laminate flooring installation diagram with their products. Once you choose your design, plan out the first and last rows first.  Start by installing your flooring parallel to the longest wall or focal point in the room:  * Measure the width of the room from the longest wall and divide the distance by the width of the planks. This will tell you what the width of the final row of planks should be. If the last row is going to be less than 3 1/2 inches wide, consider distributing the width needed between the first and last rows. * To calculate the width needed for the first and last row, add the width of a full plank to the width needed for the last row. * Divide that number by two and cut each plank in the first and last row to that width.    Tip: Leave a 3/8-inch gap along both walls to allow for expansion of the flooring.  ## Cut Laminate Flooring  !A person uses a laminate wood cutter to cut planks for flooring.  The great thing about learning how to cut laminate flooring is the fact that you don't need a special saw. You can cut the planks using a table saw, miter saw, circular saw, hand saw or a laminate cutter. Just follow these best practices:  * Use a diamond blade. Laminate can be tough to cut through and may damage another type of blade. * Always check the cutting instructions for your particular flooring product.  * Cut with the finished side up. * Use duct tape to mark the plank more easily and reduce splintering. * Use clamps to help hold the planks steady while cutting.    Tip: You can use a finishing blade for the cleanest cut, but keep in mind that moulding will cover all the cut edges when the project is complete.  ## Install the Underlayment  !A man}}<|eot_id|>"}

Underlayment helps preserve and insulate the floors, dampen noise and protect against moisture. If your laminate planks are made with an attached underlayment, skip this step. If your laminate flooring didn’t come with an attached underlayment:  * Roll out two rows of your choice of underlayment and trim it to size with a utility knife. * The underlayment should meet but not overlap, as overlaps in the underlayment result in bumps under the flooring. * Duct tape the seam to hold the underlayment in place and help maintain the vapor barrier.    ## Install the First Row  !A person lays down the first row of new flooring.  * All laminate flooring will expand and contract due to temperature and humidity fluctuations. To allow for this expansion, place 3/8-inch spacers along the wall to leave a consistent gap around the edges of the floor. * If the door to the room is located on one of the shorter walls, start laying the planks on the door side of the room. This will ensure you have the clean, uncut edge at the threshold. * Begin the first row of flooring by placing the planks with the tongue side facing the wall. Install the second plank next to the first by aligning the tongue into the groove and press the plank down to snap it in place. * When you come to the end of the first row, cut the length of plank needed to complete the row.    ## Stagger Laminate Flooring  !A person placing a laminate floor board.  Staggering your laminate flooring will result in a more natural look. It also gives the flooring added stability. The seams should be staggered at least 12 inches from any adjacent seam. Here’s how to stagger laminate flooring:  * At the same place where you started off the first row, start the second row of the floor. Make sure to use a plank cut to a length greater than 1 foot. * Hold the long side of the second-row plank at an angle and feed the tongue into the groove of the installed row. Press down and snap the plank into place. * Since the fiber in laminate flooring is susceptible to water damage, make sure there are no gaps between the seams. Some products require you to use a tapping block to close these gaps. * Continue snapping planks into place until the row is complete, trimming the last plank to size. * Lay each row beginning with the remaining pieces from the previous row that are longer than 1-foot until the room is complete. * If you’re using a separate underlayment, install additional rows one}}<|eot_id|>"}

An important thing to know about how to install laminate flooring is to always refer to the manufacturer's specific instructions. Below are more installation tips:  * Allow your flooring to acclimate to the room's temperature and humidity. Place the unopened boxes of laminate planks in the space for at least 48 hours. * Check and see if your laminate flooring already has an attached vapor barrier. This will eliminate the need to buy and lay a separate product. * Securely connect each plank before moving to the next one. * Vacuum up any sawdust or debris as you go. This will prevent the laminate from getting scratched.    Learning how to lay laminate flooring isn’t difficult.

Learning how to install vinyl flooring is something you can do yourself. Vinyl flooring costs a fraction of the price of hardwood, making it a great option for beginner home improvers. This guide will give you the basics on how to install vinyl plank flooring in any room easily and efficiently.

Vinyl plank flooring is known for its versatility and durability. It is comfortable underfoot, while it still creates a sleek, attractive finish to your room. In addition to being moisture resistant, vinyl is also stain resistant and can dampen noise, making it a preferred flooring choice for families with children and pets.   For these same reasons, many people choose to install vinyl plank flooring in bathrooms and basements. However, you can also install vinyl plank flooring in your kitchen or bedroom. You can easily install it over any rigid and level surface, including concrete, wood or even up to one layer of other vinyl.  ## Choose Which Type of Vinyl Plank Flooring to Use  !Wide color selection of vinyl planks  Before installing vinyl plank flooring, determine which type of vinyl plank best suits your renovation needs. Vinyl planks can be sorted into three main categories based on their installation method: GripStrip, click-lock and glue down.  GripStrip vinyl plank flooring has a manufacturer-applied adhesive layer that connects the planks to one another. This installation method creates a floating floor, which means GripStrip vinyl planking covers the subfloor without adhering or fastening to it in any manner. Floating floors are an easy, mess-free way to install new flooring without necessarily having to remove the existing flooring.  Interlocking vinyl plank flooring, also known as click-lock, creates a floating floor. But instead of having an adhesive connecting the}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Install Vinyl Plank Flooring (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{planks, the planks interlock with tongue-and-groove joints that easily snap together for a reliable fit.  Glue down vinyl plank flooring adheres to the subfloor using either one of two types of adhesives: hard-set or pressure-sensitive adhesives. Hard-set adhesive is spread along the subfloor, and then the vinyl planks are laid down on top. Pressure-sensitive adhesive is already on the bottom of the plank and bonds to the subfloor when the plank is pressed into place. While both types of adhesives are durable, the pressure-sensitive adhesive can make replacing individual vinyl planks easier.   All three installation methods are suitable for novices, require little time and can be laid over any rigid and level subfloor. Which method you choose depends on personal preference and the room you are planning to renovate. When choosing between floating floor options, note that GripStrip vinyl plank flooring is often water-resistant, while click-lock vinyl plank flooring can be entirely waterproof.   ## Tools for Vinyl Flooring  !A person uses a vinyl cutter to trim a luxury vinyl plank.  DIY vinyl flooring requires relatively few flooring installation tools. If you're trying to figure out how to cut vinyl flooring planks, experts recommend scoring the plank with a utility knife and snapping it. Vinyl cutters are a good solution too. For more complicated cuts, consider a jigsaw or miter saw. Other tools you’ll need include measuring tape, a chalk or crayon, a straightedge and a vacuum. Some manufacturers recommend a tapping block and rubber mallet.  If you are installing glue-down vinyl planks, make sure you have vinyl floor adhesive and a notched trowel. If your room has a baseboard or moulding at the bottom of the wall, use a pry bar to temporarily remove it.  Tip: We recommend using safety goggles and work gloves during installation. Knee pads are also a good idea.  ## Preparation for Vinyl Plank Installation  !A person uses a shop vacuum to clean a subfloor.  Before you begin installation, measure and prepare the subfloor. Measure the size of the room to determine how much vinyl plank flooring to purchase. Try to ensure your measurements are as accurate as possible, then buy about 10 to 20 percent more flooring than you believe you will need. This will ensure you have enough planks to floor the entire room as well as extras for cutting or future replacements.     Your subfloor should be clean, rigid, level and free of cracks.

If you are installing vinyl planks in a bathroom, you may need to temporarily remove the toilet, or you can install around it.   If the subfloor is not level, you can fix low spots with a self-leveling product and sand or grind down high spots.  Tip: Do not try to sand down old vinyl flooring, as it may contain asbestos. Instead, remove the pre-existing vinyl flooring entirely if it is not level.   ## Planning Your Vinyl Plank Installation  !A kitchen with beautiful vinyl plank flooring.  Once you have prepped the subfloor and have decided which type of flooring to use, plan how you will lay the planks before installation in order to make the process as quick and easy as possible.    * Using the room measurements you found in the last step, divide the room width by the plank width to determine how wide the planks bordering the walls should be. For the best appearance, make sure the border plank widths are no less than half their initial width. For example, if the vinyl plank is 6 inches, you’ll want to cut it to no less than 3 inches wide. You may only need to trim the last row, but if the last row can only accommodate less than a plank’s half-width, trim the first row to make up the difference. * Plan to start perpendicular to the longest wall to keep cutting minimal. * Each package of vinyl plank flooring will have subtle differences in the plank pattern and color, so remove all the planks and shuffle them together to create a natural-looking variation. * Undercut door jambs to allow the planks to slide easily beneath them. * Cut the planks to accommodate the room size and shape, then plan to stagger their ends by about 6 inches between each row for the best appearance. * Leave the manufacturer-recommended amount of expansion space between the planks and walls.

Lower the second plank to snap the planks together. * Continue in this manner for the remainder of the row, trimming the last plank as needed. * For the second row, use the same angle-and-snap method, attaching them side-by-side to the planks in the first row as well as to one another. Continue for the rest of the room. * Trim the border planks as needed and leave appropriate expansion space between the planks and the wall. * Replace the baseboard.    ## Installing GripStrip Vinyl Plank Flooring  !A person installing a grip strip vinyl plank over a plywood subfloor.  * Lay the first row of vinyl plank flooring along the wall, leaving the manufacturer-recommended amount of expansion space between the plank’s edge and the wall (usually about 1/4-inch). If the planks are cut, make sure the cut edge is facing the wall. * Butt the planks end-to-end, overlap the adhesive strips and press down firmly using a hand roller to administer even pressure over each plank. * Continue to work across the room, making sure each plank is securely and tightly pressed together along the grip strip seams. * For the border, trim the planks to fit and press into place, while leaving appropriate expansion room as you did with the first row. * Replace the baseboard by nailing it to the wall, not the flooring. * When installation is complete, remove the spacers and roll the entire floor in both directions using a 75-pound or 100-pound floor roller.    ## Installing Glue Down Vinyl Plank Flooring  !A person uses a trowel to spread vinyl adhesive on concrete floor.  * When learning how to install vinyl plank flooring with a glue down method, remember to start in the center of the room rather than in the corners. Find the center of the room, then using your chalk and straightedge, strike a line. * Strike a second line at a right angle from the first line, dividing your room into four equal quadrants. * Measure the distance from the center point to the wall, parallel to the direction of the plank. Divide the measurement by the width of the plank. If the last plank needs to be shorter than half its width, move the center point as needed so the plank should be trimmed no more than half its original width. * Apply the manufacturer-recommended adhesive to the subfloor with a trowel, starting at the center point and working outward into the desired area. * Allow the adhesive to set somewhat until it is tacky but still cloudy/hazy}}<|eot_id|>"}

Do not allow the adhesive to rest so long that it becomes clear. * If the adhesive gets on the top surface of a vinyl plank, immediately wipe it away with a dry cloth before it can dry. * Place the first plank with its short edge at the junction of the two chalk lines. * Continue to lay the planks row by row, working along the parallel chalk line and ensuring the edges of each plank fit tightly against the neighboring plank. * Trim the border planks as needed, leaving manufacturer-recommended expansion space. * Most glue down vinyl plank flooring needs to be rolled with a floor roller after installation to firmly and evenly seat the vinyl planks into the adhesive. Wipe away or use a knife to peel away any adhesive that gets into the seams between planks. * Replace the baseboard.    ## Prepping and Treating Your New Vinyl Floor  !An electric floor scrubber cleans a floor.  After installing your new vinyl floor, the next step helps keep it maintained for years to come. New flooring usually comes with a factory seal. This isn’t always strong enough, so consider taking steps to remove it and prepare the flooring for use. These steps also work well for restoring the vinyl after it’s been used.  * Use a floor stripper to remove the factory seal, if it’s new, or any acrylic finishes and product buildup. This step gets the flooring prepared for applying better sealants and protectants. * Once the floor is stripped, apply a high-traffic floor polish to prevent heel marks, scuffs and slips. * Finally, use a neutral pH floor cleaner to give it a high-gloss shine.    Tip: You may need to strip and protect your floor every six to nine months for regular maintenance.  Now that you know how to lay vinyl flooring planks, you can easily refresh your home's floors with an entirely new look and feel. Need tools for your project? Consider a rental of well-maintained tools and equipment. Rent the tools for as long as you need them, then bring the tools back – no maintenance required.

Last updated October 16, 2023  Getting your floor level is an important first step for any flooring installation process. A level subfloor will help your flooring last longer and keep the finish attractive. How best to get the subfloor ready depends on whether it’s too high or too low. What type of flooring will go on top also affects the process. In this guide, you’ll learn how to level a floor before installing laminate, tile, vinyl and hardwood flooring.

Before you can start leveling, you need to get to the subfloor. The subfloor is the material that goes underneath the flooring to support it. For most types of floor, you can use a mallet and a pry bar. However, consult a professional for advice about which technique to use. A pro can also tell you how best to dispose of the old flooring.  For most types of floor, you can use a mallet and a pry bar. However, consult a professional for advice about which technique to use. A pro can also tell you how best to dispose of the old flooring.  Safety Tip: Wear a respirator mask, eye protection and work gloves for each step of the process. Add hearing protection when you’re working with power tools.  ## Check the Level of the Subfloor  !Someone using a long level to check for high and low spots on a floor.  To check for small high or low spots that may not even be visible, place a long level or straight pipe on the subfloor. Move it around to different areas and mark any high or low spots you find with a pencil or marker. Most floors will have at least some slight variations.   ##  Repair High Spots in a Wood Subfloor and Clean It  !Someone using a wet/dry vacuum to remove sawdust and debris from a floor.  If the subfloor is plywood or particle board, start by screwing down any loose boards or plywood sheets. Add more wood screws, if needed, to secure them.

{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Level a Floor (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{staples.  When leveling floors made of wood, you’ll need to sand down any high spots. If you expect to create a lot of sawdust, wear a dust mask and use painter’s tape to tape plastic sheeting over doors and air vents so the dust won’t spread.   Use a sander to sand the high spots. Keep checking the floor with a level as you sand it. When you’re finished, vacuum the floor thoroughly with a wet/dry vacuum or sweep it with a broom. Make a final check with the level to be sure all the high spots are gone.  ## Repair High Spots in a Concrete Subfloor and Clean It  !A man wearing a dust mask and work gloves using a sander to level a floor.  If your floor is concrete, use a concrete grinder for large, open areas or a 4-inch or 8-inch angle grinder with a cup-wheel attachment made for use on concrete. Grinding and repairing a concrete floor can create concrete dust, so be safe and wear a respirator. A dust mask will not give you enough protection.   Keep checking the floor with a level as you grind the concrete. When you’re finished, vacuum the floor thoroughly with a wet-dry vacuum or sweep it with a broom. Make a final check with the level to be sure all the high spots are gone.  ##  Repair Low Spots in Wood or Concrete Floors and Clean Them  !Someone pouring a floor leveler solution over a floor.  Use an underlayment, floor leveler or floor patch product to fix low spots in a wood or concrete subfloor.   An underlayment is a thin layer of material sandwiched between two other materials. It's used to help insulate, absorb sound and reduce wear on your floor. It can also serve as a vapor barrier.  Floor levelers are cement-based products that come premixed or as dry substances to mix with water. Choose a product recommended for your application and mix it, if needed, following the manufacturer’s directions.   Floor patches are products that help repair holes, cracks, small dips and other imperfections. Follow the directions on your product for how to apply it.  If the manufacturer recommends it, go over the subfloor with a damp sponge before you apply a floor leveler. This will help keep it from drying too fast, so you’ll have time to spread it around.  Pour the liquid-like floor leveler onto the subfloor and smooth it out with a trowel. Gravity will help it settle into the low areas. Remove any excess floor leveler and feather it around the edges so it blends with the rest of the floor. Let the floor leveler dry overnight or as indicated by the manufacturer.}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Level a Floor (part 3)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{After the floor leveler dries, sand down any high spots to make them flush with the rest of the floor.  Use a wet-vac to vacuum up dust and debris. Make a final check with a carpenter's level or straight pipe to be sure all the low spots are gone.   ## How to Level a Floor for Installing Laminate  !Someone installing planks after leveling a floor.  Laminate is a budget-friendly, attractive alternative to hardwood flooring. Laminate planks snap together and “float” above a subfloor, which means tiny subfloor imperfections are okay, although, a level subfloor will help prevent damage.  To level a subfloor for installing laminate, follow the directions above to remove high and low spots. After vacuuming or sweeping the subfloor to clean it, add a plywood layer if the subfloor is in very bad shape, but do not overlap the sheets. A plywood layer is not necessary if you are putting down wood laminate.  Finish by installing the laminate according to the manufacturer’s instructions.   ## How to Level a Floor for Installing Tile  !Someone installing tiles after leveling a floor.  Before you install tile flooring, follow the directions above for fixing high spots and low spots in a wood or concrete subfloor. Then vacuum the floor with a wet-dry vac or sweep it with a broom. Make a final check with the level to be sure all the high and low spots are gone.  To prepare a wood subfloor for installing tile, install a cement-based backerboard following the manufacturer’s instructions.   To prepare a concrete subfloor for installing tile, you’ll need to do a different kind of preparation. Tile leveling systems can help keep your tiles level, aligned, properly spaced and held in place while the tile mortar cures. Used correctly, tile leveling systems can make the process of installing tiles go faster and improve your result.  ## How to Level a Floor for Installing Vinyl  !Someone installing vinyl after leveling a floor.  Before you install vinyl flooring, follow the directions above for fixing high and low spots in a wood or concrete subfloor. You do not need to add a layer of plywood unless your subfloor is in very bad shape.

Its usefulness extends well beyond basic fencing needs.  A single small piece of chicken wire can be used in a frame for displaying photos, jewelry and other decor. Follow this guide to learn how to make your own chicken wire memo board with a thrifted frame.  ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Project Tools and Materials  2. 2  Prep the Frame  3. 3  Remove the Frame Hardware  4. 4  Clean the Frame  5. 5  Spray Paint the Frame  6. 6  Measure the Frame     See More  ## Project Tools and Materials  !Tools and materials for chicken wire memo board on table  This is a good project for repurposing an old picture frame. You can also start with a new frame.  Materials:  * Thrifted frame * Chicken wire (from a 2 ft X 25 ft galvanized steel poultry netting roll) * All-purpose cleaner * Shop towels * Metallic gold spray paint (or paint of your choice) * Felt or foam from the craft store * Sawtooth ring hangers * Small craft clips, like bulldog clips    Tools:  * Claw hammer * Nose pliers * Staple gun and staples * Tape measure * Utility knife * Glue gun * Protective eyewear * Leather work gloves    ## Prep the Frame  !Person removes backing from frame  Select the size of picture frame you would like. Use a utility knife to remove any cardboard or paper backing.  Remove photos and glass from the frame. Make sure there is no remaining paper sticking out from the sides of the frame.   ## Remove the Frame Hardware  !Person uses steel nose pliers to remove staples  Remove any hardware with steel nosed pliers.

Tip: If your frame has a glossy sheen to it, lightly sand the gloss off to provide a surface for the paint to adhere to.   ## Measure the Frame  !Person measures the frame with a tape measure  Once the frame dries, the next step is measuring.  Flip the frame over and use a tape measure to find the height and width. You'll use these measurements to cut the chicken wire.  ## Cut the Chicken Wire  !Person measures and cuts the chicken wire  Carefully roll out the chicken wire and cut it to the length and width based on the frame measurement. Add an extra inch or two all around to ensure the chicken wire covers the entire frame.  Tip: Always wear leather gloves, long sleeves and eye protection when working with poultry netting. Wire cutters and aviation snips are best for cutting chicken wire.  ## Use a Hand Stapler  !Person uses a hand stapler to attach chicken wire to frame  * Flatten the sheet of chicken wire as best you can so there are no waves or bumps. * Use a hand stapler or upholstery stapler to secure the chicken wire to the back of the frame. * Apply as many staples as needed, making sure to get a staple in each corner and two on each side at minimum.    ## Trim and Flatten  !Person trims chicken wire by edge of frame  * After your sheet of chicken wire is stapled to the back of the frame, use wire cutters to trim the excess chicken wire into the inside of the frame. * Hammer the staples and existing wire until flattened. * Leave as few sharp edges as possible.    ## Cut Backing  !Person uses scissors to cut backing for frame  Measure the width and height of the backside of your frame again and use those measurements to cut out strips from the foam or felt material for protective backing to cover any remaining sharp edges.   ## Glue Backing  !Person uses a glue gun to attach backing to frame  Glue the strips of foam or felt to the backside of the frame with a hot glue gun. The foam or felt material strips will protect your walls when you hang the frame.   ## Attach Hangers  !Person hammers hanger on frame  * Decide if you want your frame to hang vertically or horizontally. * Attach one sawtooth hanger in the center of the back of the top edge.    ## Hang Frame  !Chicken wire memo board placed above desk in a room  Hang the frame in a place where you'll be sure to see it every day.}}<|eot_id|>"}

My family and many other African Americans celebrate Kwanzaa from December 26 - January 1 to honor our history, culture, communities and families. The word “Kwanzaa” means “first fruits of the harvest” in Swahili and each day of Kwanzaa represents one of seven principles: “Umoja” (unity); “Kujichagulia” (self-determination); “Ujima” (collective work and responsibility); “Ujamaa” (collective economics); “Nia” (purpose); “Kuumba” (creativity); and “Imani” (faith).     The official red, black and green Kwanzaa colors represent the people of African descent, our blood, and our hope for the future, respectively.   ## The Kwanzaa Feast  Kwanzaa celebrations culminate with a big feast called the “karamu,” traditionally held on December 31st. This year, I updated my Kwanzaa tablescape using the vast selection of globally-inspired products in The Home Depot tableware collection, including hand-carved pieces by African artisans. All featured items are available at The Home Depot.  The focal point of my table is the DIY **stenciled** table runner. A table runner is a great way to add visual interest to a table without taking away from the other elements present. This one is designed to resemble the Kuba cloth that originated in the Kuba kingdom of central Africa, in what is now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  !Close up of a stenciled table runner with patterned flatware, and olives in a dish.  ## Stenciled Table Runner Product & Tool}}<|eot_id|>"}

Determine the dimensions that you want for your table runner, depending on the size of your table and personal preference. I designed mine to be 12” wide and 45” long to allow room to display the runner without the place settings overlapping. You can design yours to be longer or shorter.  2. Lay out the **tablecloth** on a large, flat surface. Use the **ruler** and **pencil** to draw lines to mark your selected dimensions. Use **painter’s tape** to secure the fabric to your work surface while measuring and cutting.  3. Use **shears** to cut along the reference lines to create the shape of the runner.      !Person marking a tablecloth with a ruler and pencil.  4. Turn the fabric over so that you can see the stitching. Fold the unfinished edges over to create a ¼” hem.       5. Place the fabric **tape** along the unfinished edges; it’s helpful to work in smaller, cut sections of tape (about 8-10 inches) at a time.  6. Peel back the white strip from the fabric tape. Fold the edge over following the indentations from Step 4. Press down to secure the tape.     !Person using scissors to cut a tablecloth.!Person peeling back fabric tape from a tablecloth.!Person pressing down folded edges of a tablecloth.  7.

Place a drop cloth down or other covering to protect your work surface from the black **paint**.  10. Squeeze about a quarter of the paint bottle into a disposable bowl.  11. Secure the stencil to one end of the fabric using painter's tape. There’s a triangle in the bottom right corner of the stencil to use a guide when placing it on the fabric; make sure that the triangle is facing up each time that you place the stencil on the fabric to repeat the pattern.     !A tablecloth, stencil, bowl, and paint brush over a measurement board.  12.

Behind the table, I set up my Kwanzaa display with the seven symbols of Kwanzaa. The primary symbol of Kwanzaa is the “kinara” (candle holder), which holds the **red**, **black**, and **green** candles that each represent one of the seven Kwanzaa principles called the “Nguzo Saba.” I added a modern, chic touch to the traditional wooden kinara design using these **hand-carved soapstone candle holders**.  !Minora candles on top of a console with corn, and a bowl with fruits.

Through decorative details, handmade items and carefully selected tableware, you can learn how to create your own cozy tablescape perfect for the season.    ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Prep and Create DIY Napkins  2. 2  Lay the Foundation  3. 3  Add Plates  4. 4  Set Up Each Place Setting  5. 5  Bring in the Centerpiece  6. 6  Add Extra Details and Enjoy     ## Prep and Create DIY Napkins  !Cloth napkins wrapped in DIY burlap napkin rings.  Before you begin the DIY portion of the tablescape, gather your supplies and set them nearby. Having everything handy will help streamline setting the table. For the napkin rings you'll need burlap, scissors and cloth napkins.   Adding a DIY touch, like burlap napkin rings, to your tablescape can up the warm and welcoming vibes. Bonus points for coordinating the colors of the napkin and the burlap.  Here's how:  * Fold napkin into a neat rectangle. * Cut out a rectangular piece of burlap that’s slightly larger than the folded napkin. Cut out a long strip about the length of a shoelace. * Place the folded napkin on top of the piece of burlap. * Tie both fabrics together with the strip of burlap, wrapping the string like you would around a present, and place the final bundle on top of the plates.    Here's everything else you'll need to make this merry tablescape:   * Dinnerware * Glassware * Serving dish * Serving bowl * Candles * Placemats * Runner * Seasonal centerpiece * Garland * Utensils * Serving utensils * Matches or lighter    ## Lay the Foundation  !A natural fiber runner is added to the center of a table.  * Clear the table, setting aside your napkins and napkin rings. * Lay down a runner. This look calls for a runner in a natural fiber. It's the perfect backdrop for any look, including this rustic scene. * If any lumps form in the runner, try to smooth it out and let it settle; however, the centerpiece and garland will hide any imperfections.    ## Add Plates  !Two blue plates are stacked on top of one another.   * It's time to add color to your natural tone foundation. We chose plates in a cool blue for a bit of a fresh winter style, but plates in any shade (think greens or even a winter white) can work with this neutral background. * At the center}}<|eot_id|>"}

If using, stack a salad plate on top of the dinner plate.    ## Set Up Each Place Setting  !Four place settings with plates, silverware and napkins.  * Place a glass down at the upper right of the plates. * Arrange the utensils in this order from the left: the salad fork and the dinner fork to the left of the plates; the knife and the spoon to the right of them. * Repeat steps 1 through 4 for every seat at the table.    ## Bring in the Centerpiece  !Garland and rustic wood centerpiece are added to the table.  * Now, it's time to set the centerpiece in the center of the table. Use a simple but classic piece of garland to bring a bit of the outdoors in. * Snake the garland around the base of the centerpiece and carefully arrange any excess.    ## Add Extra Details and Enjoy  !A finished table with food, place settings, garland and more.  The beauty of this tablescape is the mixture of elements and textures. Add extra details like candles in metallic tones to bring in appeal.   * Arrange the candles around the centerpiece and amid the garland. Light them when everyone is ready to be seated. * Eat, drink and be merry!    Put a twist on your ordinary holiday meal by recreating this merry holiday tablescape.

{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Make a Terrarium (part 1)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{!thumbnail  Published December 7, 2023  You don’t need a lot of space to have a garden. You don't even need to go outdoors. With a glass container, some potting soil, pebbles and a few houseplants, you can learn how to make a terrarium, a kind of miniature garden, to enjoy inside your home. This is a fun project to do for yourself, as a gift or with your kids.   Difficulty:  Beginner  Duration:  Under 2 hours   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  What is a Terrarium?  2. 2  Choose Plants and Prep the Container  3. 3  Add Base Layer  4. 4  Add Soil and Plants  5. 5  More Terrarium Ideas     ## What is a Terrarium?  !A woman standing over a terrarium.   A terrarium is a glass jar, bowl or other transparent container used to grow small plants, and it works like a mini-greenhouse. After you water the plants in the container, water begins to condense inside. When it drips back down onto the plants, they get another watering, which makes a terrarium very low-maintenance.   An open terrarium is just what it sounds like. It’s a container with an opening that lets air circulate. In an open terrarium, you’ll need to add more water from time to time, as it will eventually evaporate, and the soil and plants will begin to dry out.  A closed terrarium is a glass container with a lid. It should be opened about once a month to let fresh air in. While it’s open, some of the moisture inside also evaporates, so you’ll need to add a little more water. You just won’t need to water as often as with an open terrarium.  ## Choose Plants and Prep the Container  !A woman adding sand to a terrarium container  You'll want to start by choosing your plants for the terrarium. Choose small plants that need the same basic amounts of light and water for your terrarium. Good choices include:  * Small ferns * Creeping Fig * Polka Dot Plant (Hypoestes) * Pothos * Baby’s Tears * Nerve Plant (Fittonia) * Peperomia * Dwarf Black Mondo Grass * Golden Clubmoss    Next, prep the container. Start with a clear, clean glass container. It will be easier to add the plants if you choose one with an opening large enough to reach inside. You can make a simple tool to use for small openings.  ## Add Base Layer  !A woman adds rocks to a terrarium   * Add about one inch of pebbles in the bottom. If the opening is narrow, put them on a paper plate and fold them into a funnel shape. Put the tip of the funnel into the neck of the container and gently shake the pebbles out. If you don’t have a paper plate, use a few}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Make a Terrarium (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{sheets of newspaper. The pebbles will let excess water drain away from the plants. If plant roots sit in water, they won’t get enough oxygen and will die. * Put a light layer of activated charcoal chips over the pebbles. Stores that carry pet and fish supplies will likely have this charcoal. It will help absorb odors that can build up over time, especially in closed terrariums. * Add a layer of moss over the charcoal to help keep the charcoal from floating when you water the plants. If you can’t reach into the container, fold the moss or tear it into small pieces and drop it in. If you need to move the moss around, use a wooden skewer or a chopstick.    ## Add Soil and Plants  !A woman adds soil and moss into a terrarium   * Use your funnel to add a couple of inches of potting soil over the moss. * Remove your plants from their nursery containers and gently loosen the roots with your fingers. If you’ll be looking at only one side of the terrarium, put taller plants toward the back. Remember to leave room for them to grow and don’t crowd too many into the container. * Use a spoon or your fingers to make holes for the plants in the potting soil. Add a cork to the end of your skewer or chopstick to make a tamping tool and use it to gently firm the soil around the plants. * If you get any soil on the glass, use a small, dry paint brush to remove it. * Add another layer of moss around the plants for a finished look or use more pebbles or sea glass. Water lightly with a small watering can or spray bottle. Avoid watering so much that water collects in the bottom. * Trying adding small tools, shells or other decorations to your terrarium, if desired. Small children’s toys, like plastic dinosaurs, to make a fun “prehistoric jungle” terrarium. * Keep your terrarium out of direct sunlight, so the sun coming through the glass won’t burn the plants. Prune them when needed and rotate the terrarium occasionally, so they don’t lean in just one direction.    ## More Terrarium Ideas  !A person adds accents into the terrarium.   Try different kinds of plants and vary your decorations to make unique terrariums:  * Grow miniature African violets in a terrarium to enjoy their colorful blooms. Be aware that they'll need more care than most other small houseplants. Give them an open terrarium, because water evaporates slowly from closed containers. They can die if they stay too wet. They also need good air circulation. * Follow the directions above for making a terrarium but use}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Make a Terrarium (part 3)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{African violet potting mix instead of regular potting soil. Position your plant so that it's not touching the glass. Keep the terrarium in bright, indirect light. Water lightly when the soil begins to dry out. Remove faded flowers and any leaves that show signs of fungus, mildew or other problems. In a humid terrarium, diseases and pests can spread fast. * For another unique look, use air plants in an open container. They need air and small amounts of water that they absorb through their leaves. They don’t need soil, so just put them inside the terrarium and mist them a few times each week. In hot weather, take them out once a week and soak them in a bowl of water for an hour or two. In cold weather, mist them a few times each week. Soak them about every two to three weeks. Use rainwater, purified water or tap water that can stand for 24 hours so the chlorine can evaporate. * Keep your air plants in bright, indirect light and they may bloom for you.    Knowing how to make a terrarium allows you to build a mini garden in your home. Play around with different plants and accents to make yours unique. Ready to start your project?

{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Make Over Your Laundry Room (part 1)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{!thumbnail  Last updated September 7, 2023  The laundry room or space might be the hardest working but least appreciated part in your home. Whether your household includes two people or ten, laundry is non-negotiable. Treating and folding seemingly endless loads can go easier in a more inspiring space. With these fun and functional upgrades, you may enjoy doing laundry. Read on for how to easily add style, organization and storage to your laundry room.  Difficulty:  Intermediate  Duration:  Over 1 day   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Plan Your Makeover  2. 2  Organize the Area  3. 3  Maximize Space  4. 4  Install Helpful Storage  5. 5  Add Decor  6. 6  Upgrade Appliances     ## Plan Your Makeover  !Two laundry bins sitting on top of a counter.  Start by looking around the area or room where you do laundry. Try to see it as if you’ve never been there before. Then, ask yourself the following questions:      * What is this workspace lacking that can easily be added? * What additions could make this room work better for how I use it? * How could this room be more pleasant and visually appealing?       Think about adding game-changing additions like countertops, hanging rods and new appliances to make the space work more efficiently. Consider fun decor updates such as a mood-boosting paint color or wallpaper, new flooring and on-trend lighting.   ## Organize the Area  !Storage bins placed on shelves in a laundry room.  Nothing relieves stress quite like having a place to store everything. The right organization can handle everything from where to put loose change to sorting laundry properly.      * Detergent and stain removers will be easy to locate when gathered in a plastic caddy or stored in a drawer over the washer and/or dryer. * Label cabinets and drawers so everyone remembers where everything goes. * Handle the perpetual pile of dirty clothes by investing in some easy-to-store, stackable laundry baskets to set on a counter or tuck inside a cabinet. * A rolling bin with divided compartments can also solve the sorting dilemma.    ## Maximize Space  !Someone hanging an iron board on the wall.  Take advantage of every inch of space no matter the size of your laundry space.   * Hang the ironing board on the back of the door or on a sliver of wall space. Cabinets, both lower and upper, are perfect for hiding supplies and more. * Mount adjustable shelving. They’re ideal for storing hangers, steaming and pressing items or oversized bleach and detergent bottles. *}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Make Over Your Laundry Room (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{Budget-friendly cube storage fitted with handsome baskets or bins also offers style and function. * Give found items, such as single socks and pocket treasures, a home. Keep counters clear with a small basket hanging near the dryer, or a jar for coins.    ## Install Helpful Storage  !Someone using a pull-out caddy stocked with laundry supplies.  * Add handy storage such as a pull-out shelf for laundry supplies. * Imagine the joy of folding clothes as soon they come out of the dryer, or sorting endless loads without breaking your back. Add countertop space to create an instant workspace. * If you have a laundry sink, hang a rod above it for drip-drying large items. * Drying racks (wall-mounted or collapsible) can handle smaller, delicate items.    ## Add Decor  !A colorful wallpaper hung over a laundry sink.  Since the makeover goal is transforming your laundry room into your happy place, give it the same decorative touches the rest of the house enjoys.    * Upgrade the lighting with a chandelier or signature fixture. * Wake up the walls with fresh paint, water-resistant wallpaper or clean-lined paneling. * Choose a washer and dryer in eye-catching colors like gold, yellow, pink or merlot. * Cabinets don’t have to be boring. Coat them in a soothing paint or stain and accessorize with new pulls and knobs. * Install hardworking flooring in practical and pretty looks, from cement tiles to peel-and-stick vinyl to laminate wood. * A simple rug can warm up the space. Make sure it has a slip-resistant backing. * Give extra impact with unique accessories. Transfer powdered detergent and boosters to large clear containers with a metal scoop. * Add a TV or Bluetooth speakers so you can binge a show or dance your way through ironing.    ## Upgrade Appliances  !A stacked washer and dryer installed in a laundry room.  Consider trading out that water-guzzling washer and single-setting dryer for a shiny, new set. Switching from bulky side-by-side units to stackable machines opens up more storage space. New tech allows you to spend less time scrubbing and sorting and more time enjoying your day. From anti-wrinkle to steam clean mode, new washer and dryer features make laundry less of a chore. Plus, there’s the money and water you’ll save with high-rated ENERGY STAR units.  To make doing laundry more convenient, look into smart appliances. Many units include things like Wi-Fi, dryer syncing, custom cycles or even an app to control the machine or alert you when a load is}}<|eot_id|>"}

It’s a simple step that could potentially save you money and aggravation. It’s a lesson you don’t want to learn the hard way.  Difficulty:  Beginner  Duration:  Under 2 hours    ## Table of Contents  1. 1  How to Measure a Room  2. 2  How to Measure for Furniture Delivery     ## How to Measure a Room  !A person holds a measuring tape against a floor  You’ll need a few tools to measure your space.   * Tape measure    Every homeowner should have a cased tape measure. They’re invaluable for hanging pictures, DIY projects and measuring rooms.  * Paper and pencil    Letter size paper, lined or unlined, on a pad or clipboard. Sharp pencil or pen.  * Step stool (optional)    For reaching difficult spots.  * Friend (optional)    For moving furniture and helping with measuring tape, and most importantly, double-checking measurements.  * Painter’s tape (optional)    For marking off furniture on the floors and walls.  Measuring a room, step by step:  1. To begin, clear the space to be measured as best you can.   2. Next, roughly sketch the room on the paper. Mark the openings like windows, doors and steps. Include architectural features like fireplaces and bookshelves.   3. With the measuring tape, measure the length and the width of the room. Stand at one wall, extend the tape measure across the floor and press it against the opposite wall, at the baseboard. Note measurement on the sketch.  4. Measure the height of the ceiling. Note measurements on your sketch.  5. Measure the doors and note how far into the room the door swings.   6. Measure the architectural details: Put the tape against the wall and measure the distance from the wall to the window. Measure the window from trim to trim. Measure from the window trim to the opposite wall. Add these measurements to your sketch.     Remember that walls, floors and ceilings can be uneven, especially in older construction. For this reason, it’s a good idea to take measurements at several positions in the room.  Consistency is important when you measure. Outside edge to outside edge is the standard when measuring a room.  How to measure for furniture:   * In a bedroom, measure the bed first, center it on the wall and choose night stands to fit on either}}<|eot_id|>"}

Once you have the furniture measurements in place, you can measure for rugs. You want the largest area rug that will fit in the space.  * In a dining room, you’ll need 3 to 4 feet between the table edge and the wall. This leaves room for chairs to be pulled away from the table.     Tip: You can use painter’s tape to mark the places on the floor where furniture will go. This will help you envision how the furniture will fit in your room.  ## How to Measure for Furniture Delivery  !Person measures a door opening  A key step when ordering furniture is ensuring that you will be able to get the furniture inside your home once delivered. Always measure doorways and stairways before placing your furniture order.  Know the height, width and depth for the furniture that you want in your space. This can be found in the product details in the online description.   Measure doorways, pathways and stairways to your home. If there are elevators and hallways, get those measurements, too, including the elevator door opening. These measurements must be greater than the furniture dimensions in order for the furniture to be moved into your space.  When measuring, you’ll want to use the interior measurement of the doorways, passageways and hallways. Note the placement of architectural details like doorknobs, light fixtures and trim like chair rail on your sketch.  Tip: Measure twice for accuracy. Ask a friend to help with running the tape measure and making sketches.  Properly measuring your room for furniture will help you design a comfortable living space and will save aggravation with furniture delivery.   With proper planning and precise measurements, you can get the right size furniture for your space. Start by measuring the entryway for delivery. Always measure twice to avoid issues down the road.

Freshly painted walls brighten small spaces and add warmth to large rooms. We’ll also discuss how using a paint sprayer can help speed up the process.

Prep work is the first and most important step when painting a room. Follow these steps below when preparing a room for interior house painting. You should know that these steps apply whether you’re painting on your own or using a paint sprayer.:  * Remove all furniture and fixtures, including lights, blinds, HVAC registers and outlet covers. * Carefully inspect surfaces for cracks, holes, dents or other imperfections. * Use a putty knife and lightweight spackling compound to fill and repair holes and cover imperfections. * Remove excess spackling with the putty knife. Allow to dry following manufacturer's instructions before painting. * Use a small piece of fine 220-grit sandpaper or a sanding sponge to smooth the repaired areas flush with the surface. Some surfaces might require a specific sandpaper. Be sure to read the manufacturer's guidelines before sanding. * Wipe surfaces clean with a damp towel or sponge and let dry. A heavy-duty cleaner may help to remove dirt and grease from the walls and trim. Be sure to keep rags, buckets, water and paint sticks nearby for mixing. These will also come in handy for cleanup and mixing afterward. * Wear old clothes and a hat while painting. * Make sure you have rubber gloves and eye protection on hand. * Whenever you start any interior house painting project, always work in a properly ventilated space. You must open all windows and doors. You should also use fans and proper safety gear, like a respirator mask and ventilator. This keeps the area safe and free of paint particles, especially with strong fumes.    Safety Tip: When painting interior walls, make sure to follow EPA guidelines if the existing paint contains lead.  ## Plan It Out  !Ladder, paint and other materials on drop cloth in empty room.

Painting a room in the correct order will also reduce drips and runs. A good rule of thumb is to always start with the ceiling. Next, paint the walls and end by painting baseboards, windows and door trim.  Tip: Maintain efficiency by getting enough paint. A gallon of paint can roughly cover between 250 and 300 square feet of wall space. Determine exactly how much you need with our paint project calculator.   ## Apply Painter’s Tape for Painting  !Someone applying blue painter's tape to prep a space.  The next step in prepping and painting interior walls is to use apply painter's tape. It is used to mask off trim, baseboards, windows, doors, doorknobs, power outlets and other fixtures. You should also remove the hardware from furniture.  * Press painter's tape firmly in place to prevent paint from seeping underneath or bleeding through. * For non-textured surfaces, apply painter's tape at the edge of the wall. Place painter’s tape in short, overlapping strips for more control and best coverage. * If you have a textured ceiling and are painting only the walls, run a screwdriver along the ceiling's edge. This creates a small, unnoticeable, texture-free surface for the painter's tape to adhere to. It is then easier to create a straight paint edge. * If you're painting an accent wall, mask off the inside edge of the wall from the rest of the room.    Choose the right painter's tape or masking tape adhesion level for the job. Some are perfect for textured surfaces. But others are intended for more delicate areas, like a freshly painted wall, finished hardwood or wallpaper.  ## Spread Drop Cloths When Painting a Room  !A man and woman lay down a drop cloth in a room.  Cover the floors, furniture, fixtures and any other areas with drop cloths or a tarp to protect them from paint drips, spray and splatters. Move furniture out of the room or move it to the center. Then, cover it with drop cloths.  * Canvas drop cloths are both durable and absorbent. They can also be reused. * Plastic drop cloths are durable and budget-friendly but not absorbent. Spills are more likely to be tracked if stepped on. * Paper is the most economical type of drop cloth but can tear easily when laid out on floors. Paper is better for covering light fixtures, cabinets and furniture.    ## How to Prime Walls for Painting  !Woman applying white primer on a wall with a roller.  Apply primer before painting walls. Primers are designed to help seal the}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Paint a Room (part 3)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{wall and prevent mold. A primer is essential if you are changing from dark paint color to a lighter one. Some primers can be tinted to match the color of the paint. Primer is more budget-friendly than paint. So, a tinted primer can provide coverage at a lower cost, saving you money on paint. Many brands also offer paint and primer in one.   * Begin by using a high-quality paint brush to brush paint 2-3 inches along the edge of the wall, windows and corners of a room. This process is known as \"cutting in.\" * For best results, work in one small area at a time. * You may want to follow the process of \"edging painting.\" This involves cutting in the wall's edges before painting rolling or painting the entire wall. Doing so prevents the borders from drying before you finish painting the wall. It also keeps the sheen uniform. If edging, use an angled brush to apply a thick coat.    Next, start painting primer onto the wall in 3-by-3-foot sections.   * Choose the right roller cover for your wall surface and place it onto your paint roller. For smooth ceilings, use a low nap roller. For a textured ceiling, use a thicker roller, with a 1/2-inch or 3/4-inch nap. * Pour primer into a paint tray. * Dip the roller into the paint, making sure it’s completely covered. * Roll the paint roller over the ridged area of the paint tray a few times to remove excess paint. * With a fully loaded paint roller, work top to bottom. Roll it back and forth across the wall in a series of V- or W-shaped strokes. * Roll in one section at a time, moving from top to bottom and from one side of the wall to the other. The goal is to achieve even coverage, with no drips. Press lightly on the roller to prevent drips and lines. * Reload the roller and paint the next section. Cover only as much as you can finish while the primer is still wet. Overlap areas of wet primer only.    Tip: Do not try to get opaque coverage. If the wall still shows through, you may have to apply a second coat of primer to the wall before painting with your paint color.   ## Sand the Primer Before Painting the Room  !A woman sanding primer on a wall.  Once the primer dries, lightly sand bumps and ridges using fine grit sandpaper folded into quarters.  * When the grit of one section of sandpaper becomes covered with dust, switch to an unused section and continue. * Wipe the wall clean with a damp towel or sponge and let it dry. * Follow the manufacturer's instructions for adding additional coats of paint to the wall.}}<|eot_id|>"}

Paint walls one at a time. Blend the wet paint you’ve brushed on with wet paint you’re rolling. Also known as “working to a wet edge,\" this is one of the best painting tips and techniques for walls.   * Working from top to bottom, roll the paint roller back and forth across the wall in a series of V- or W-shaped strokes. Do this until the section is covered. * Before reloading your roller and moving to the next section, roll over the area you’ve just painted. Use a smooth, continuous stroke, going from top to bottom. These smoothing strokes even the coat, catch any drips and help to cover up lines and tracks. * Overlap areas already painted. Lightly lift the roller off the wall to avoid leaving end marks. This also lets you seamlessly blend different areas. * Frequently remix paint, using a mixing stick or a paint mixing tool. Do this any time you leave your paint sitting for an extended period of time. * Wait 2-4 hours for the first coat to dry before applying a second coat. * Follow the same process and techniques used when priming walls, blending sections as you work. * To prevent paint from drying on the roller, store your paint roller in a plastic bag between coats. This will keep the paint and brush moist between uses. * Keep your paint color uniform. Once you’ve used half a gallon of paint, refill that can with paint from a different can and mix together. If you’re doing a large job, mix several gallons into one 5-gallon bucket.    Tip: If you have a large area to paint, consider using a paint sprayer to apply paint quickly and evenly.   ## Wrap Up & Clean  !Someone removing blue painter's tape from a baseboard's top.  When you have completed painting, clean and remove paint on floors and other surfaces. Take time to clean your tools, so they're ready for your next painting job.  * Remove painter’s tape right before or right after paint dries completely. If left on too long, small pieces of tape will tear and leave residue when being removed. * Use a painter's knife to slice through any painter's tape that is stuck. You might also have to use paint thinner to remove stubborn paint drips. * Apply a small amount to a cloth and gently rub over the drip. Take care not to rub too hard or it might remove paint on the floor or wall, along with the drip. * Tightly seal remaining paint in cans. * Clean paint brushes and rollers with warm soapy water. *}}<|eot_id|>"}

Many people prefer to rent a paint sprayer from The Home Depot when taking on new projects. This is a good option if you’re short on time or physically unable to paint. With a paint sprayer, you can cover large areas faster. You’re also able to quickly complete smaller painting jobs, like tables or chairs.  * Choose a medium-duty paint sprayer for projects requiring 15 gallons or less, like small rooms, furniture and outdoor spaces. The most versatile model, it's lightweight and easy to maneuver. It also doesn’t require an air compressor. * For projects requiring over 15 gallons, choose a Pro paint sprayer. It has a much larger capacity but keeps the smaller version’s same ease-of-use and maneuverability.    ## Using a Paint Sprayer  !A masked man using a paint sprayer on a wall.  Here are some helpful tips for optimal paint sprayer performance:  * When picking a paint, it should flow smoothly through the sprayer. Airless paint sprayer rentals use oil-based paints. They’re better than latex or water-based paints, which can be thicker and clog machines. * Have all necessary painting tools and equipment ready before starting a project. Besides the normal materials, you may need special items. For instance, a fiberglass twin stepladder or scaffold set may help for higher walls and ceilings. If you have to paint large, open indoor areas, such as warehouses, The Home Depot has scissor lifts for rent that can rise up to 40 feet. * Be sure to follow the sprayer’s operations manual for all steps. Practice first, using a piece of scrap drywall or cardboard. This will allow you to use the sprayer correctly, using a smooth, back-and-forth motion. You can also figure out the distance needed for proper coverage. * Always begin your stroke movement before using the trigger to release paint. Then, end the stroke after releasing the trigger. Doing this prevents paint from building up on the surface. Regularly wiping your paint sprayer nozzle with a rag prevents clogging. * When using a sprayer, first paint corners and complex areas. You can then move on to flat surfaces, working top to bottom. * Once your project is completed, let the paint dry for 24-48 hours. Next, remove the painter’s tape and drop cloths. You can then move your furniture back into the room and continue designing. * Make sure you return}}<|eot_id|>"}

Last updated December 26, 2024  Can you paint tile if your home has ceramic or mosaic tiles in a dated design or color scheme? For an inexpensive update, consider adding a new coat of paint. When finished properly, painted tiles look great in almost any room. You can paint on ceramic tile and almost every tiled surface in your home. However, painting tiles in a shower doesn’t usually work. This guide covers painting tiles in the bathroom, shower and other areas of the home and how to paint tiles effectively.

Before you undertake this big project, take the time to choose the right paint for the job. While any kind of paint can technically be used, only some kinds of paint should be used for best results. Look for tile paint when possible.  * Enamel paint is either oil-based with alkyd resins or water-based with acrylic binders. * One-part epoxy paint is an all-in-one paint that can be used right out of the can without any mixing. * Two-part epoxy paint requires mixing two chemical components, a curing agent and a base, before it can be used. * Two-process paints take two steps to apply: a bonding agent application and then a top coat. * Can you paint tile with latex paint? While latex paint is common, it’s not recommended. It’s not long-lasting enough for most tile applications.    Both epoxy and enamel are efficient for painting tile floors with heavy traffic, though either may have an edge depending on the exact situation.  ## Clean the Old Tile  !A person washes green and white checkerboard kitchen tile with a sponge.  As you learn how to paint tile, you’ll need to do some prep work. Get started by cleaning the tile thoroughly.  Most tile is located in high-use areas such as kitchens and bathrooms where grime or soap scum can build up, so use extra care when painting tiles in a shower, for instance. Use a commercial cleaner and sponge to scrub tiles. Rinse with clear water and allow tile to dry. If needed, apply a degreasing cleaner on kitchen tile backsplashes to make sure they are completely clean.  ##}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Paint Tiles (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{Repair Tile and Grout  !A person patches damage on a wall of green and white checkerboard tile.  Tile is durable and looks great for years. However, it can show signs of wear and tear. Before painting tile floors or walls, inspect the surfaces carefully. Use a putty knife to fill cracks and chips with caulk. Scrape away any excess and wait until repairs dry before moving to the next step.  Take time to repair the grout around the tiles as well. Little flaws can be fixed with a small amount of grout from a tube. Wear gloves and use your finger to rub in the grout. Wipe any extra off with a cloth. If the grout is in rough shape, it may need to be removed and replaced entirely.  ## Sand Old Tile  !A person sands a wall of green and white checkerboard tile.   Most tile is finished with a layer of glaze for protection. For paint to adhere to tile, the glaze must be removed. Use a minimum of 100-grit sandpaper to hand-sand, or machine-sand tile with a sander before painting it. Gently rub the surface with sandpaper, taking care not to damage the tile's surface. When finished with sanding, use a damp cloth to wipe away any sanding grit.    ## Apply Primer to Tiles  !A person wearing a face mask applies primer to green and white checkerboard tile.  After sanding the tile, get the area where you’ll be painting ready for painting. Use a drop cloth to cover the floor. Put painter’s tape on any surfaces and fixtures that you don’t want to get paint on.  Whether your goal is to update mosaic tiles for a hallway or painting bathroom tiles with a splash of color, one of the most important steps in learning how to paint tiles is using a primer. Primers hide unwanted colors and designs. When you’re painting tile, using bonding primer will help new paint adhere better to the tiles. It can also help keep the paint from chipping and peeling in the future.  Working on clean, dry tile, roll the primer evenly over the tiles. Use two coats if necessary, letting primer dry between coats before moving to the next step. If you are hand painting tiles, use a small paint brush to paint details onto the tiles.   As you’re applying primer and painting tile, work safely. Make sure the area is well-ventilated. Wear a mask, gloves and protective eyewear.   ## Paint Tiles with Special Paint  !A woman uses a roller to paint a kitchen tile backsplash bright yellow.

Use a roller to apply paint evenly to the tile as directed in the manufacturer's instructions. Make sure to paint grout as well.  * Use a brush to paint corners and edges. * Use a roller for the main part of the painting surface. * Be sure to load the roller cover, paint only onto still-wet paint, and start rolling at least six inches away from edges and corners. * As you paint, overlap strokes a small amount and roll very close to the walls and corners to cover brush strokes. * For a smoothing, blended finish, gently roll over the painted areas again with your non-loaded roller.    Let the paint dry for 24 to 48 hours so that it is dry and not tacky to the touch. Add a clear coat of polyurethane sealant if desired.  ## Add a Pattern  !A person uses a stencil to paint a blue pattern on a white tile floor.  To give wall or backsplash tiles a refreshed look, you can add a pattern. Use a stencil when painting bathroom tiles or kitchen tiles.  * Find a stencil that suits the size of your tiles. Before you start adding the pattern to your tiles, practice stencil painting on a piece of cardboard.  * Start with a clean tile floor. Priming the tile will help the stencil paint stick to it. * Plan the pattern so it will match the tiled space you want to paint. Use painter’s tape to cover the edges of the area. * Begin stenciling on one of the edges. Work on one tile at a time. Lay the stencil on the tile. Use painter’s tape to secure the stencil. You can apply the paint with a brush or a sponge.  * The key to pretty stenciling is using the right amount of paint. Dab a little paint onto the stencil and tile at a time, adding more if you need to. * When you’re done painting the pattern, allow plenty of time to let it dry. Depending on how you’re working, you may need to let one stencil dry before adding the next.     ## Drying and Curing  !An hourglass on a table depicts the passage of time.  What’s the difference between drying and curing paint? Drying refers to evaporation of the water or solvents in the paint. It will feel dry to the touch. Curing, on the other hand, is when the paint has completed its chemical bonding with the surface. At this point, it will have reached maximum hardness.  While paint is curing, the surface shouldn’t be used. If it’s a floor, for example, it shouldn’t be walked on yet.  Read the paint can’s instructions for drying time between coats. Curing takes much longer and depends on the type of paint. Both}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Paint Tiles (part 4)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{drying and curing depend on the paint, the thickness of the layer(s), the ambient temperature and humidity, ventilation/air circulation and other exterior factors. Curing can take anywhere from four to 30 days.  ## Longevity and Maintenance  !A toddler sits on a tile floor and plays with toys.  Now that you’ve finished painting your tile, it’s critical to take care of it so it’ll last longer. Painted tile isn’t going to be as durable as new tile. So you’ll have to take some precautions.  * Consider adding a layer of sealant to protect the surface, especially if it’s a floor. * Have a routine for regular cleaning: sweeping, vacuuming, damp dusting and mopping. * Put down floor mats or rugs on sections that get heavy usage. * Wipe up any water as quickly as possible. * Clean only with products suggested by the manufacturer. Harsh chemicals and even some natural cleaners may damage the paint or sealant.    ## Pros of Painting Tile  !A person uses a roller to cover a wall of small tile with paint.  So can you paint tile? Yes, and knowing the pros and cons of painting tile can help you decide if this project is right for you.  Pros include:  * Painting tile is a budget friendly alternative to putting in new tile. * It’s a DIY project that almost anyone can do. Painting tile is much easier than installing tile. * You won’t have to take out the old tile or figure out how to dispose of it. * Getting ready to paint tile includes making minor repairs to your existing tile, which can improve its appearance.    Cons include:  * Paint doesn’t last as long as the finish on tile. The paint you apply may come off over the years. Paint might not be the best option for high traffic tile, such as floors. * Similarly, painting tiles in a shower, painting tiles in the bathroom, or painting any other tiles that get wet often may be inefficient. * When you paint tile, the grout will be painted over, too. You’ll no longer see the contrast between the grout and tile. * You need to do a thorough job of cleaning and repairing the tile before you get started. * While the paint dries, you may not be able to use the room the tile is in.

You can make standard brackets more interesting with a simple coat of paint. Plain metal shelf supports can be painted to blend in or stand out against the wall color, and there are even specialty spray paint options that will give you metallic, mirrored or textured finishes for a truly bold statement.  Note: Pay careful attention to the manufacturer's instructions regarding weight limits as you try out your decorative shelf ideas. Going over the limit could result in the shelf failing, causing all the items on it to crash to the ground.  ## Hanging Flower Baskets  !Three decorative brackets hold hanging flower baskets on an outside wall.  While you can use brackets by themselves to add to your decor, adding hanging flower baskets are a great adornment.

Priming walls is an important step of painting that can increase paint adhesion, produce a uniform finish, improve sheen and block stains.  This guide will teach you how to prime walls for painting.  Difficulty:  Beginner  Duration:  Over 1 day    ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Priming Considerations  2. 2  Purchase Primer  3. 3  Prepare the Wall  4. 4  Cover Other Surfaces  5. 5  Dampen Roller or Brush  6. 6  Cut-In Corners and Spot Prime     See More  ## Priming Considerations  !Two people applying a coat of primer to an unfinished wall.  If you’re wondering, “Do I need to prime before painting?” know that priming walls adds texture to them. When applied over primer, the paint can adhere to the surface better. Whether you’re learning how primer should look on a wall or how to prime new drywall, primer helps paint produce a good finish on the wall. It also helps cover existing paint colors and blemishes.  * Wall surfaces like drywall, masonry and wood are porous. If you don't use primer, they can absorb paint unevenly. You might end up adding more coats of paint than you planned to. * On walls that are already painted with a glossy finish, or when using latex paint on top of an oil-based finish, a new coat of paint applied directly on top might have trouble adhering without a coat of primer for it to hold onto. * When painting over a dark-colored wall, a coat or two of primer provides a clean and neutral canvas for a lighter paint color to refresh your room. * Primer is typically less expensive than paint. Using primer instead of several coats of new paint may lower the cost of your paint job. * Primer works well to cover previous paint colors and flaws or spots on the wall. But if your walls are in great shape and the new coat of paint is a similar color to the old one, you may not need primer.    ## Purchase Primer  !Four buckets of primer placed on a driveway next to a pickup truck.  Water-based latex primer and oil-based primer are both suitable for priming interior walls. Latex primer is considered an all-purpose primer and is easy to clean up with water. Oil-based primer is also versatile. It's the preferred choice for blocking stains, wood tannin and for covering porous wood surfaces.  Be sure to have enough paint primer before starting your project. Trying to figure out how much primer you need? A gallon}}<|eot_id|>"}

Two coats of primer may be required over heavy stains or tannin-rich wood.  Most primers can be tinted to help ensure good coverage for the finish coat. Bright or deep colors require a tinted primer. A store associate will determine the amount of tint to add to the primer following the manufacturer’s specifications and based on the color of the topcoat being used.  ## Prepare the Wall  !A person uses a scraper to prepare a wall for a coat of primer.  As you learn how to prime a wall, it will need some prep work. Remove any HVAC registers, outlet covers, light switch plates, and nails or other hanging hardware. Then inspect walls for cracks, holes, dents or other imperfections.  * Use caulk or a lightweight spackling compound and putty knife to fill and repair any holes or imperfections. * Remove excess spackling with the putty knife. Let dry completely. * Use a small piece of very fine 220-grit sandpaper or a sanding sponge to smooth the repaired areas flush with the surface. * Wipe the walls clean with a damp towel or sponge and allow them to dry.    ## Cover Other Surfaces  !Paint primer, painter's tape, a paint roller and paint tray sit on a drop cloth on a floor.  The next step as you figure out how to prime a wall is to protect any surfaces that you don’t plan to paint.  * Use painter’s tape to mask off moulding, trim, windows and the ceiling. * Cover the floors with a drop cloth to protect them from paint drips and splatters. * Move furniture out of smaller rooms. In larger rooms, move furniture to the center of the room and cover the pieces with additional drop cloths.    ## Dampen Roller or Brush  !A paint roller resting in a paint tray with primer.  It is difficult for dry rollers and dry brushes to absorb primer. Dampen your paint roller or brush to get off to a fast start. Use water if applying latex primer. For alkyd or oil-based primer, use paint thinner or mineral spirits.  Brush out the liquid on a clean piece of cardboard to remove loose bristles. Squeeze out excess from a roller by rolling on cardboard or a towel.  ## Cut-In Corners and Spot Prime  !A person using a paint brush to apply primer on a wall at the edge of the ceiling.  A key technique when applying primer to walls is the \"cut in.\" Cutting in is basically outlining the wall with a 2 to 3-inch band of primer around the edges.  Pick your starting point and cut in.

Next, brush primer on areas of walls and trim that need special attention. These spots can include joint compound, patches in drywall and plaster, areas of bare wood exposed by scraping or sanding, and any places treated with stain blocker.  When applying primer, wear safety glasses or goggles to protect your eyes.  ## Roll on the Primer  !A person using a paint roller on an extension pole to apply primer to an unfinished wall.  For the larger spaces of the wall, apply primer using a 9-inch paint roller with a 3/8 to 1/2-inch high quality roller cover.   * Fit the moistened roller cover onto your paint roller. * Stir and pour the mixed primer into a paint tray. * Dip the roller into the primer, making sure it’s completely covered. * Pass the paint roller over the ridged area of the paint tray a few times to remove excess primer. * Start with a single vertical strip at the cut-in corner. * Apply the primer in 3- x 3-foot sections. With a fully loaded paint roller, work top to bottom, rolling back and forth across the wall in a series of V or W-shaped strokes until the section is covered. * Roll in one section at a time, moving from high to low and from one side of the wall to the other. * Reload your roller and move to the next section, covering only as much as you can finish while the primer is still wet. Always overlap areas of wet primer. * If a second coat of primer is necessary, apply it after the first coat has dried according to manufacturer’s instructions.    ## Sand Primer  !A person wears a dust mask while using a sanding block to smooth a coat of primer on a wall.  Once the primer is applied, the surface of the wall needs to be smoothed out to become ready for a coat of fresh paint. You’ll need to know how to sand primer once it dries.  The drying time for primer varies depending on a number of factors, including temperature, humidity and air circulation. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines on the primer can.  * After the primer dries, lightly sand away bumps and ridges using very fine grit sandpaper folded into quarters. * When the grit of one section of sandpaper becomes covered with dust, switch to an unused section and continue. * Wipe the wall clean with a damp towel or sponge and allow it to dry before painting.

Learning how to remove bathroom tile or tile in any room doesn’t require on-the-job experience. You'll just need a few tools and a fair amount of time. Some subfloor upgrades may be necessary, so plan for those as well. Use this guide to learn how to remove a tile floor or wall, plus get tips on how to remove ceramic tile properly.

Preparation and allocating enough time will make all the difference in successfully completing this project. Removing tile from walls or floors correctly requires the right tools. You can use manual or power tools. For smaller projects, a chisel and a ball peen hammer are more than adequate. For larger projects, such as removing backsplash tile, consider using power tools. An angle grinder or oscillating tool are popular choices.   You’ll also need a pry bar, a floor scraper, trash bin and trash bags, shop vac or broom, knee pads and safety glasses. If you’re going to be using power tools, wear safety equipment to protect your ears as well.  ## Remove Grout  !Someone removing tile grout with a chisel.  How to remove a tile floor, fireplace tile or wall tile starts with loosening and removing old grout. There are a few ways to do this depending on the tools you have at hand and the size of the project. For small jobs, hand tools can work well. Here’s how to use hand tools for this DIY tile removal:  * Use a ball peen or masonry hammer and cold chisel to tap the pieces free. Always wear safety glasses when removing ceramic tile. * In some cases, the only way to tear out the ceramic tile is with heavy equipment such as a jackhammer or air chisel.    Got lots of grout or a large space to deal with? That’s not uncommon if you’re working with hallway, living room or kitchen tile. Here’s how you can use power tools to make the job faster and more efficient:  * Use a grout saw or rotary tool to cut along the edges of the grout. Aim to cut as deeply as you can. * Throw chipped pieces away and wipe up excess dirt and debris. A wet/dry vacuum can be helpful for this task.    ## Remove the Tile}}<|eot_id|>"}

Once you’ve taken care of the grout with your hand or power tools, separate the tile from the mortar underneath. Sometimes you can simply pry it up. However, tile usually won’t just come off the floor or wall. Here’s how to remove stubborn tile from a wall or floor:  * Start by scoring the old tile. To do that, put a straightedge across one of the diagonals. Guide a scoring tool along the straightedge, scratching a line in the tile. Repeat until the line is at least 1/16-inch deep. Repeat on the other diagonal. * Use a long-handled floor scraper to scrape away tile fragments and any old adhesive residue. After all the tiles are removed, you may need to smooth the subfloor with a sander.    Tip: For a particularly difficult tile, strike the center of the tile with a center punch. The tile will begin to break up. Put a cold chisel on the diagonal near the center and strike it with a hammer. Repeat along the entire length of both diagonals until you’re able to remove all of the tile pieces.  ## Remove the Mortar  !Someone using a drill to remove old tile morter.  After your old ceramic tile is up and removed, clean your workspace of any debris. Next, remove as much of the old mortar as you can. Here’s how you can do that:  * Using a hammer and a bricklayer’s chisel, tap away at the mortar. * Clean up loosened tile as you go. * Continue tapping and removing as much mortar as you can. Leave firmly attached mortar in place as long as there is enough room for a new layer of thinset.    ## Prepare the Subfloor  !Someone using a circular saw on a wood subfloor.  Once you’ve figured out how to remove a tile floor, take the next step. Evaluate your subfloor for damage. Look for uneven or sunken parts, squeaks and obvious water damage. A good subfloor ensures your new tile lays correctly. If parts of your subfloor need work, here’s how to cut and remove it or any damaged areas:   * Cut the old subfloor into small sections with a circular saw equipped with a carbide blade. * Pry up the sections with a pry bar. If the old tile was laid on underlayment, cut through the underlayment and mortar but not the subfloor. * Replace the subfloor. Consider having this work done by a professional floor installer.    ## Tile Removal Tips  !Slippers placed on black and gray bath tile floor.

Here’s a few more tips on how to remove tile from a wall or floor:  * Start by removing a few tiles to see how difficult the project will be. * Replacing a few cracked or damaged tiles may be a better plan than replacing an entire floor or wall. * If the tiles are relatively loose, try using the floor scraper to remove several rows at a time. Wedge the spade under the tiles and “shovel” to break them up. * Older tile can be firmly attached to the subfloor and very difficult to remove. Consider renting a jackhammer with a chisel when removing a tile floor. Be especially careful to wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from the flying tile and mortar chips.

Unless you’re working with removable wallpaper, taking off wallpaper prints can be a messy project that requires a little care. This guide reviews to how to remove wallpaper using various methods, as well as the various wallpaper tools required.   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Choose a Wallpaper Removal Method  2. 2  Prepare the Wall  3. 3  How to Remove Wallpaper With Liquid  4. 4  How to Remove Wallpaper With Gel  5. 5  How to Remove Wallpaper With Steam  6. 6  Wallpaper Removal Tips     ## Choose a Wallpaper Removal Method  !A woman removing wallpaper.  Choosing the best way to remove wallpaper from your home depends on the type of wallpaper on your walls and your preferred removal method.  * Some newer homes use removable wallpaper, also called temporary wallpaper. Use a scraper or putty knife to loosen an edge of the wallpaper at the corner of a room and carefully try to pull off a strip. Removable wallpaper should peel off easily. * Strippable wallpaper is designed to last longer than removable wallpaper, but softens easily when soaked with hot water. * Wallpapers designed to be water resistant or washable, such as vinyl wallpapers, need a stronger method, such as a chemical wallpaper remover. * Gel removers are less messy than liquid removers and can be more effective in removing wallpaper that has been applied to unprimed drywall or has used clay-based adhesives. * Wallpaper steamers can be used on any wallpaper and may be the only recourse with old, stubborn wallpapers that are hard to remove. Buying or renting a steamer may be more expensive than other methods.    Safety: If you decide using chemicals or steam is the best way to remove wallpaper in your home, always wear rubber gloves and protective eyewear.  ## Prepare the Wall  !Wallpaper cleaning supplies stand next to a wall.  Take the following steps before removing wallpaper in a room.  * Take everything off the walls, such as hanging pictures or vent covers. * Remove or cover furniture. * Wallpaper removal can lead to spattering water or chemicals, so put down drop cloths and fix them to the top of baseboards with painter’s tape. * Have a large trashcan with a plastic liner ready for placing the wallpaper sheets or pieces. * To protect an electrical outlet on the wall, cover it completely with painter’s tape.

Liquid wallpaper removers contain wetting agents designed to dissolve the old adhesive.   * Before using liquid remover, water-resistant wallpaper should be scored or perforated so the remover will be able to contact the adhesive between the paper and the wall. Roller-style wallpaper scorers are extremely effective at puncturing the wallpaper with dozens of tiny holes. Use light pressure when running the scorer over the wall to avoid scratching the wall. Blade-based wallpaper scorers are cheaper but slice lines into the wallpaper and are less effective. * Apply the liquid remover with a spray bottle for quick coverage over a larger area, but use a sponge or other tool in corners or places where precision is required. * Allow the solution to soak the wall as specified by the manufacturer’s instructions. * Once the liquid remover has softened the adhesive, peel off the paper or use a paint scraper or putty knife to remove it.    ## How to Remove Wallpaper With Gel  !A person applies wallpaper remover with a spray bottle.  Gel removers function in a manner similar to liquid removers. The surface of the wallpaper must be perforated prior to application to allow the chemicals within the gel to penetrate and weaken the adhesive.   * One advantage to using a gel is that it's somewhat less messy. It won't drip or run, allowing for more precise application and reducing the likelihood of it spilling onto the floor or furniture. * Gels are often effective in removing wallpaper that has been applied to unprimed drywall or used clay-based adhesives. A good gel should liquefy the adhesive without softening or soaking the face of the drywall. * Use a spray bottle, brush or roller to apply and let sit for 20 to 30 minutes so it can soak in. * After the gel has soaked the wallpaper, use a scraper to peel up the wallpaper in strips.    ## How to Remove Wallpaper With Steam  !A person uses a steamer to remove wallpaper.  Removing wallpaper with a steamer is a relatively easy and effective technique against the most stubborn prints that resist chemical removers.  * Begin using a wallpaper steamer by filling the tank with water. Turn it on and wait for it to heat up. As soon as the ironing plate begins to emit steam,}}<|eot_id|>"}

Safety: When removing wallpaper with a steamer, always wear gloves and protective eyewear to avoid burns.  ## Wallpaper Removal Tips  !A person uses a scraper to remove the remnants of wallpaper from a wall.  Consider these tips when learning how to take off wallpaper.  * On some wall coverings, especially vinyl-coated styles, the outer layer may simply pull away from the paper backing, leaving only the paper and glue to be removed. * Utility knives will come in handy when removing wallpaper borders and trim along cabinets. * You can try mixing your own wallpaper remover solutions, using either 1/3 vinegar to 2/3 hot water or 1/4 fabric softener to 3/4 hot water. Apply with a sponge or spray bottle. * Start at the top of the wall and work your way down when applying chemicals. * After removing the wallpaper, clean and remove the excess adhesive by applying a solution of hot water and a small amount of trisodium phosphate (TSP). Wipe the walls with the cleaning solution, rinse with a sponge and clean water and towel dry. * Use spackle or sandable filler to patch any nicks or gouges in the wall.    Tip: You may be able to safely paper over a single layer of smooth, well-adhered wallpaper if it is free of bubbles, buckles and wrinkles. You will need to do some prep work, including re-pasting any loose paper and cleaning the walls before applying new wallpaper.  DIY wallpaper removal can be messy and require a lot of detail work. As long as you follow the wallpaper removal steps, you should be able to get your room ready for a whole new look.

Learning how to apply wood stain allows you to bring out the rich colors and textures of the wood. This guide will show you how to stain wood and include tips for staining wood furniture.  Difficulty:  Beginner  Duration:  Under 2 hours  ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Repair As Needed with Wood Putty  2. 2  Sand Thoroughly  3. 3  Wet the Wood  4. 4  Apply Conditioner or Filler as Needed  5. 5  Stain the Wood  6. 6  Remove Excess Stain     See More  ## Repair As Needed with Wood Putty  !A person uses putty to fill in a crack.  The steps to staining wood begin with examining what you plan to stain. If the wood has damage on the surface, use wood putty or filler to fill in any holes or divets.  Sand and clean the surface of the wood. Then, apply wood filler using a putty knife. Once filler is dry, sand the area until the surface is level and smooth. Then apply stain or other finish as desired.  Tip: As the name suggests, stain can leave permanent discolorations on whatever it touches. Put down drop cloths and take all other precautions when staining wood. Follow these steps to learn how to apply wood stain like a pro.  ## Sand Thoroughly  !A person sands a handrail.  * When preparing wood for stain, you’ll need to sand its surface. Use a sanding sponge or orbital sander. Sandpaper with a lower grit number will make wood rougher, allowing more stain to absorb and creating a darker color. * Start with 120-grit sandpaper for pieces that already have a finish. With unfinished wood, start with 80-grit sandpaper and then treat it as if you're refinishing it. * When you have removed imperfections and sanded the entire surface, wipe off the dust and loose sandpaper grit. * Sand with 180-grit until you've removed all the marks left by the 120-grit and the surface appears level. * Brush clean.    Tip: When learning how to stain furniture, remember that a chemical wood stain remover can extract stain from places the sander can't reach. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for using chemical stain removers.  ## Wet the Wood  !A woman wets a wooden handrail with a cloth.  * Wipe down the wood to raise the grain. If you don't raise the grain at this point in the process, the stain will raise it later. However, re-sanding to get the wood smooth again removes much of the stain. * Let the wood dry,}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Stain Interior Wood (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{then sand with 180 to 220-grit paper. * Remove dust with a clean cloth.    ## Apply Conditioner or Filler as Needed  !A person applies wood filler.  As you continue to learn how to stain wood, take the type of wood you’re working with into account.   * Some softwoods, like pine, and some hardwoods, such as cherry, turn blotchy when stained. In this case, consider applying a pre-stain wood conditioner, which seeps into the wood fibers to seal the material and prevent the uneven absorption that causes blotching. * If you use a gel stain, you can apply it without needing a conditioner. * Some woods such as mahogany and oak have an open-grain structure that needs filling to provide a smooth finish. Grain filler is a pigmented paste that comes in a variety of colors. Choose one to match the wood or stain color and apply with paint brushes or rags to the manufacturer’s instructions. * Remove excess with a scraper and lightly sand after drying.    ## Stain the Wood  !A person applies wood stain to a wooden handrail.  * Thoroughly stir the wood stain before applying. * Use a rag or cloth instead of a sponge, which may absorb the stain. When applying, the cloth should be wet but not dripping. Test on a piece of scrap wood. * You can apply stain across the grain of the wood or with the grain of the wood. The way you apply the stain onto the wood is less important than applying plenty of it. Follow manufacturer’s directions for the staining application instructions. * Stain usually cannot be removed after application. It's better to apply thinner coats and add more as needed, rather than apply too much and have a darker color than you want.    ## Remove Excess Stain  !A person uses a rag to remove excess wood stain from a handrail.  * Remove the excess stain with paint rags by wiping with the grain. You can use old T-shirts as rags, if that's what you have. * If the stain has dried too much, it will be difficult to remove. Loosen it by applying more stain and rubbing vigorously. If it dries hard, paint thinner will loosen it.    ## Apply Sealant as Needed  !A person uses a brush to apply sealant to stained wood.  * Applying a topcoat sealer is not required, but a finish protects the stained wood from scratches and keeps it from fading over time. * If applying a polyurethane wood finish with a brush, apply one to two coats. * If using a spray can, hold 8 to 12 inches from the surface and apply two or three light coats. * Be prepared for drying time to take at least a}}<|eot_id|>"}

Types of wood stains include oil-based, water-based and gel-based. Use safety equipment and follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using any wood stain. Don’t mix different types of stains while working on a project.  If you’re focusing on how to stain a wood table or other large pieces of furniture, oil-based stain is typically a good choice. Because they take more time to dry, oil-based wood stains come out more evenly. They’re also more durable. Oil-based stains contain harsh chemicals. Work outdoors or in a well-ventilated space, like a room with the windows open.   To clean rags and brushes used with oil-based stain, use mineral spirits. Follow the manufacturer’s safety instructions when working with mineral spirits, especially when it comes to disposing of the rags you use. When not dried and properly discarded, they can burst into flames.  Water-based stains dry quickly and work well for smaller projects. Because they penetrate the surface, water-based stains raise the grain of the wood. Water-based stains are more environmentally friendly than oil-based ones, though you should still take safety precautions. Also, all you need to clean up after using water-based stain is soap and water.  Gel-based stains are a cross between a wood stain and paint. These stains are thicker and provide better control of the color. They are messier to work with than water-based or oil-based products. To clean up after using gel-based stains, use mineral spirits.   Learning how to apply wood stain provides an alternative to painting a piece of furniture while emphasizing its natural color and texture. When using interior wood stains, mastering how to apply stain can give any wood surface a whole new look. As you figure out how to stain wood, remember that stains add color, but don’t protect the wood. To prevent damage from water, light and everyday use, you’ll need to add a finish to the wood.   To find all the stains you need to complete your project, shop using The Home Depot Mobile App.   ## Related Products  See More  ## Related Guides  ![Types of Wood Stains and Finishes for Interior Use](https://www.homedepot.com/c/ab/types-of-wood-stains/9ba683603be9fa5395fab90b89c64a3)  Types of Wood Stains and Finishes for Interior Use  ![How to Apply Exterior Wood Stain](https://www.homedepot.com/c/ah/how-to-apply-exterior-wood-stain/9ba683603be9fa5395fab9053528990)  How to Apply}}<|eot_id|>"}

I am so excited to show you how to build and tile a basement shower. I’ll walk you through every step of the process from sheetrock, to shower pan, to tile. Installing the shower is the first thing we did in our basement bathroom. To follow along with the whole bathroom process, you can check out my blog, The Creative Mom.  !How to Tile a Basement Shower  ## Step 1: Prepare Shower Stall  We considered using a shower insert for our basement bathroom, but since our shower stall wasn’t a standard size, we decided to tile it. We started with a sheetrocked shower stall and concrete floors. These instructions will also work with a wooden sub floor.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  ## Step 2: Prepare Plumbing  You will want to make sure your plumbing is in order before you start working on the shower stall. When we built our home, we stubbed in a shower drain and faucet, but we didn’t have a P-trap, so before we could get the shower installed, we needed to get a P-trap installed. It did involve breaking out a little concrete, but it was easily patched with some fill gravel and concrete before we started installing the shower stall. You’ll also want to make sure the plumbing for your shower head is ready to go. The valve we needed came with our Pfister Venturi shower head.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  ## Step 3: Prepare Shower Pan  We had two big concerns with putting in our basement shower. The first was the shower pan- we were worried putting in a shower pan by ourselves because we weren’t sure how to get the slope and drain just right. The other concern was waterproofing- we weren’t sure what product would be best for waterproofing.  We were excited when we found the Schluter Kerdi system on HomeDepot.com, because it solved both of}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Tile a Basement Shower (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{our big problems at the same time! The Kerdi system has a pre-formed shower pan, so we didn’t have to worry about putting in cement and making sure our slope was perfect. It also came with a preformed curb, which was a huge plus!  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  And if you are wondering what is in our drain, it’s a baseball- the perfect solution to keep fumes from coming up through the drain. Once we have water going in the shower, it will sit in the P-trap and prevent fumes. Until then, we found that a baseball did the trick.  ## Step 4: Waterproof  Our other concern, waterproofing, was taken care of too. We were especially concerned with waterproofing around the shower head and handle, and how to make sure the drain met with the slope of the shower properly. The Kerdi system came with waterproofing fabric, seals for the shower head and handle, and even a drain that fit perfectly with the shower pan. All of it worked together like a charm!  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  We just felt like the Kerdi kit really solved all of our problems. The Home Depot also sells waterproofing options like Red Gard and PVC shower liners, if this Kerdi system doesn’t give you all the happy feels like it did us. I’m not going to walk you through the install process of the Kerdi shower kit, because Schluter has such a great step-by-step video, that I think it’s best to follow that video very closely for best results.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  ## Step 5: Tile Shower Floor  Once the shower pan and walls were installed and everything was waterproofed, we were able to start tiling. We started with the shower floor. Because I didn’t want to have to cut tiles to match the slope of the shower pan, I used these adorable little penny tiles. Installing them was really easy. I started by cutting one edge of the tiles with my wet saw, so the edge was square and even.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  Then I started laying in the back corner, working my way across the back wall and then forward. You will spread a layer of thinset with the notched side of your trowel, then lay your tile. Take your time on these penny tiles. Because you don’t use spacers, you’ll need to be very deliberate and careful to make sure everything stays straight and level. You’ll also need to cut the tile to fit your drain. We used an angle grinder to cut the tiles so they fit perfectly around the drain.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  ## Step 6: Tile Shower Curb  After our floor tile was laid, we cut some}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Tile a Basement Shower (part 3)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{Schluter tile edging to match the length of our curb and up the edges of our walls.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  Make sure you get the right thickness of tile edging- our penny tiles were 1/2″ thick, while our wall tiles were 3/8″ thick, so we had to get different tile edging to match the tile we were using. We set the Schluter tile edging with our thinset, and then tiled right up to the edges with our penny tile. I think the Schluter tile edging makes all the difference in the way the tile looks when you’re done.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  ## Step 7: Tile Walls  We let our floor and curb set overnight so we could stand on it to tile the walls. Once we were ready to tile the walls, we put down some cardboard so we didn’t drip thinset on our floor tiles. We used 3×12 Daltile Subway Tiles in bright white for our walls. The price on these tiles was so good! They give a lot of bang for their buck. We started by laying the back wall. We centered our first tile in the center of our back wall, then we tiled out and up from there.  You will spread a layer of thinset with the notched side of your trowel, then lay your tile. Make to keep the tiles level. Since the shower pan is sloped, you want to make sure you use a 2 foot level, and check every so often to make sure you are keeping your tiles level. We used 1/8″ tile spacers to keep our tiles spaced and even.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  You’ll want to start on the wall you look at straight on, then move to your side walls, that way you won’t see your grout lines. So after we got our first row done on our back wall, we moved to our side walls. Since we didn’t really care if the tiles on those walls were centered, we started with half of a tile and worked our way outward. Then on the next row, we started with a whole tile. We continued that pattern upward.  ## Step 8: Add Shelves  One of the advantages to building your own shower is that you can add as many shelves as you want! And you know what I always say, “a shower can never have too many shelves”- just kidding, I never say that. But really, I do like a lot of shelves in the shower so soap and shampoo bottles don’t end up on the floor.  We installed three of these cool corner shelves. I’m not going to lie, I was intimidated by these shelves when I first saw them. They are pretty heavy duty, and I thought there was no way they were going to stay on the wall with just thinset. But I was wrong! They are really amazing and super easy to install.  !How}}<|eot_id|>"}

When we got to the row where we wanted the shelf, we installed the shelf first, with a layer of thinset, then tiled the row meeting up to it. That way we knew exactly what size to cut our tile. We did have to cut a couple of tiles in sort of an L-shape to have it fit up to the shelf, but the coolest part is that the tile slides in behind the shelf, so you can’t see the edge of the cut tile behind it.  Our bottom shelf was installed about 2 feet from the shower floor, and the top shelves just shy of 4 feet from the shower floor. We were big fans of these shelves.  ## Step 9: Cut Openings for Faucet and Shower Head  Eventually you will need to cut out the hole for your faucet and shower handle. We used an angle grinder to cut the tile to the shape we wanted BEFORE we put the tile on the wall. The Home Depot also sells diamond hole saws, but we weren’t worried about making it pretty, since our faucet handle has a big plate to cover any mistakes we made. You’ll need to do the same thing for your shower head.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  Continue tiling until you get to the height you want your shower. Since our basement ceilings aren’t very high, we knew we wanted our shower to go to the ceiling. We had to cut the last tile to fit up to the ceiling. If you aren’t tiling up to the ceiling, I suggest finishing off your edge with Schluter tile edging.  After I paint the ceiling, I will apply a layer of caulk where my ceiling meets my tile. That way, we know the seam is watertight and we don’t have to worry about water or vapor getting behind the tile at the top. You can get caulk that matches your grout, so that will help it look really nice at the top. But like I said, that will wait until after I paint the ceiling, which I didn’t do yet, because I knew I would probably get grout and thinset on it.  ## Step 10: Grout  Let your tile sit overnight to dry completely before you start grouting. You’ll need grout (of course), a grout float, a 5 gallon homer bucket of clean water, and a sponge. I swear by these sponges with the scrubber thing on one side. It really helps if you let the grout sit for a little too long before wiping it off. I also used premixed Fusion Pro grout in Natural Gray (#09). I decided to go with this grout because it never needs sealing, which is so nice! And I went with the premixed, because I wanted to be}}<|eot_id|>"}

Please note that I am an incredibly messy grouter- my whole grouting process could have gone a lot faster if I’d have stayed cleaner with my grout.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  When you are grouting, you want to start with your walls first, then go to your floor. Basically you smear the grout on with your float and make sure it smooshes into your spaces between the tiles. Then you go behind and wipe the excess grout with a clean, wet sponge. You’ll want to make sure you keep your water and your sponge clean. Once you have your tile pretty clean, you can let the grout sit for a few hours and cure. Then go back with a clean, wet sponge and give it a really good wipe down. If you didn’t get the Fusion Pro grout, you will have to seal it after the grout cures completely.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  Make sure you grout right up to your Schluter tile edging. You’ll want to make sure there aren’t any gaps at all. Also, the grout will stick to the Schluter tile edging, so make sure to wipe it down really well while it’s wet, or you’ll spend a lot of time scraping dried grout off later. Don’t ask me how I know that! haha!  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  And make sure you clean your corners out really well. Your grout will tend to pool in the corners, so use a putty knife or the corner of your float to get the excess grout out of the corners and out from under the shelves.  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  ## Step 11: Install Shower Head  Once your tile is done, you can install your shower head and handle. I used the Pfister Venturi in Black, and it is SOOO perfect!  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  After you’ve installed your shower head, check for leaks in the fittings, let your grout cure for at least a day or two, and enjoy your new basement shower!  !How To Tile a Basement Shower  This was the first step in our basement bathroom install.

Painting with a sprayer makes the work easier for big or small jobs. You can stain a bench with a sprayer or use one for spray painting a house.   This guide explains how to use a paint sprayer to get the fresh look a new coat of paint brings.  Difficulty:  Beginner  Duration:  2-4 hours  ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Choose a Paint Sprayer for Your Project  2. 2  Prep Before Using a Paint Sprayer  3. 3  Choose the Paint for the Sprayer  4. 4  Practice Using a Paint Sprayer  5. 5  Use the Paint Sprayer  6. 6  Clean the Paint Sprayer     ## Choose a Paint Sprayer for Your Project  !A woman uses a paint sprayer to paint a small table in a workshop.  The three common types of paint sprayers are airless sprayers, High Volume Low Pressure (HVLP) sprayers and pneumatic sprayers. When deciding between an air vs. an airless paint sprayer, consider the following:  Airless paint sprayers are used by skilled novices and professionals for large surfaces, such as interior walls and house siding. This type of sprayer uses pressurized force to deliver a large volume of paint quickly. Airless spray painting can deliver paint at a rate of a half gallon to 2 gallons a minute. Choose an airless sprayer if using a paint sprayer does not require much precision work to complete a big job.  HVLP paint sprayers are suitable for detailed applications that require accuracy and a smooth finish. These types of paint sprayers use air flow and paint volume controls for fast and even paint delivery. The output of paint from HVLP paint sprayers can cover large surfaces quickly. They are also effective for touch-up work. Choose a standing or a lightweight, stationary model of an HVLP sprayer to avoid arm fatigue.  Pneumatic paint sprayers use compressed air. They can apply a greater volume of paint than airless and HVLP sprayers. They are used for precision application of paint in detailed commercial and industrial work, such as motor vehicle body parts.   ## Prep Before Using a Paint Sprayer  !A paint sprayer, paint, wood stain, cleaning cloths and other materials sit on a small, round table.   When you use a paint sprayer, you’ll go through more paint than if you use a brush or a roller. Make sure to have enough paint to finish your project.  Before you start prepping for your project, check the weather. Temperatures below 45 degrees Fahrenheit (F) can cause}}<|eot_id|>"}

Days hotter than 75 degrees (F) can make paint dry too quickly, so it won’t stick to the surface of what you’re painting.   Painting with a sprayer requires some preparation of the work area.  * If the painting job is in a room or in a workshop, make sure it is well-ventilated. Open the windows in the work area and use window-mounted fans to exhaust the paint vapors. Use a face mask or respirator mask to prevent breathing in airborne paint particles and gloves to keep hands free of paint spatter. * Cover the floor, rugs and furniture with drop cloths or tarps to shield from paint spatter. * Apply painter's tape to baseboards, light outlets and window and door sills to protect them from errant paint. * Have buckets on hand for mixing paint and to collect rags or paper towels to clean up spilled paint. * Use large pieces of cardboard or scrap material to practice painting with the sprayer.    ## Choose the Paint for the Sprayer  !A person pours paint into a bucket for mixing.  The paint of choice used in sprayers should flow smoothly and evenly through the sprayer’s hose and out the nozzle without clogging. You’ll want to know how to thin paint for a sprayer. The lower the paint viscosity, or consistency, the better to use in a sprayer.   * Airless paint sprayers work with oil-based paint or stain. Typically, you shouldn’t need to thin paint for an airless sprayer. * HVLP paint sprayers work with oil-based paint. Thicker paints, such as water-based latex, can clog the sprayer. Combine a half-cup of water for every gallon of latex paint in a bucket and stir thoroughly to thin its consistency before using latex paint in an HVLP gun. * Pneumatic paint sprayers work with oil-based enamel, acrylic and latex paints. * Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for specific details on selecting paint and thinning it for the sprayer you’ll be using.    ## Practice Using a Paint Sprayer  !A person sprays blue paint on a piece of cardboard to practice using a paint sprayer.  Practice with the paint sprayer before the project to get comfortable with how it works, especially if you’re a novice at using one.    * Fill the sprayer’s reservoir with paint and spray a large scrap of cardboard propped up on a wall. Scraps of drywall also work fine to practice on. Take your time learning how to use a paint sprayer and have several pieces of scrap material on hand. * Try various vertical and horizontal spraying movements to get a consistent pattern}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Use a Paint Sprayer (part 3)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{of paint onto the surface of the scrap material. You want the surface to achieve a uniform look when using a paint sprayer. * Holding the spray gun close to a surface applies more paint and creates a narrower spray pattern. Practice holding the spray gun closer to the surface for that result. * Holding the gun farther away from the surface creates a thinner coat of paint and a wider spray pattern. Work on how to use a paint sprayer to create that result, as well. * If you hold the sprayer too far away, the paint can dry before it reaches the surface. If that happens, you might need to respray the surface and take even more time to complete the project. Also, your paint supply won’t last as long.    ## Use the Paint Sprayer  !A man standing on a ladder uses a paint sprayer to paint the siding on a house.  As you start painting with a sprayer, move it in a broad stroke motion before pulling the paint gun trigger. Doing this prevents too much paint from building on the surface where it’s being applied. Continue the stroke after releasing the trigger.   * Note how the paint lands on the surface when you start spraying. Speed up or slow down as needed to get the coverage even and consistent. * Spray straight toward the surface and avoid directing the spray at a steep angle. * Adjust the tip of the sprayer for a vertical or horizontal application pattern. * Avoid swinging your arm back and forth. Instead, move your arm carefully back and forth to spray. Do not over flex your wrist. Keep the gun positioned to prevent spray arches that can make an uneven coating of paint. * Regularly wipe the tip of the paint sprayer with a rag to prevent paint from drying and disrupting the spray pattern. * Paint any eaves and corners first. Work from the top down. * Clean the entire spray painter thoroughly, following the manufacturer’s instructions once your project is finished. * Do not store paint in the paint sprayer for any extended period. * Keep safety in mind when operating a paint sprayer. Never aim the sprayer at a person or animal. * Paint that lands on the skin from a high-pressure sprayer can be hazardous. If that happens, seek immediate medical attention.    ## Clean the Paint Sprayer  !A person uses a cloth to clean a paint sprayer.  When you’re finished using a paint sprayer, it will need to be cleaned. The methods for cleaning air vs. airless paint sprayers differ slightly. For both types of sprayers, though, you need to empty out the paint. You’ll also need to}}<|eot_id|>"}

Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for specific details on cleaning a paint sprayer.  Knowing how to use a paint sprayer can shorten the time it takes to refresh the look of a room or house exterior. Read the operating instructions before starting the work. Practice with the paint sprayer before using it for a job.

Published April 5, 2024  Keep your outdoor wood and masonry surfaces looking good for years. Waterproofing wood and masonry protects decks, patios, wood siding, basement walls and driveways from damage caused by water, sunlight and mildew. This guide will show you how to waterproof wood and masonry.   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Why Waterproof Wood and Masonry?  2. 2  Types of Waterproofers  3. 3  How to Waterproof Wood  4. 4  How to Waterproof Masonry     ## Why Waterproof Wood and Masonry?  !A large wood deck with patio furniture.  Weatherproofing wood and masonry will not only prevent it from moisture damage, but it also protects it from UV rays, humidity, frost and insect damage. Waterproofing wood and masonry will not completely make it immune to potential damage, but it will lengthen its lifespan.     Waterproofers enhance the natural color of the wood on your deck or patio, adding a hint of color while providing a clean finish. Any wood exposed to outdoor elements needs to be treated even if it’s covered by a porch. Waterproofing wood can help prevent:  * Cracks, warping and splitting resulting from collected moisture. * Discoloration, wear and breakdown due to UV rays. * Scratches caused by foot traffic and deck chairs. * Mold, mildew and ground-in dirt from leaves accumulated in damp corners.       Masonry waterproofers prevent water from seeping through cracks in basement walls, garage floors, concrete block walls, swimming pools and fountains. Most homeowners know the pains of dealing with a wet basement. Water seepage into a basement occurs for a few reasons: poor workmanship, the natural settling of a house on its foundation, or excessive water pressure. Waterproofing masonry offers prevention against many things, such as preventing:  * Damage before it occurs by providing a tough water barrier. * Leaks that allow water to enter and cause damage. * Keeps mold and mildew from forming on basement walls. * Masonry waterproofing can be used after water damage has already occurred.    ## Types of Waterproofers  !Close up of a wood deck waterproof sealer.  There are two basic product categories for waterproofing: stains and sealants. Stains are used on wood to enhance color and make them weather resistant. Sealants protect concrete and wood from moisture but do not stop water movement through the concrete from the outside. For masonry, the sealants are the go-to product.      Wood waterproofers:  * Wood sealers: Oil-based}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Waterproof Wood and Masonry (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{stains penetrate the wood more deeply than water-based finishes. Water-based products are easier to clean and can be applied to dry or damp wood. * Clear waterproofer for wood: These products are specifically designed for wood and usually include mildewcides and help wood resist fading. Clear waterproofers enhance the natural wood grain’s appearance. Reapply every one to two years. * Tinted waterproofer for wood: Contain mildewcides and offer greater UV protection because they contain pigment. The color or tint enhances the wood color and allows the wood grain to show through. Reapply every two to three years.    Masonry waterproofers:  * Clear masonry sealer: Masonry sealers do not provide true waterproofing, but they do repel water and allow water vapor to move through the material. Apply these products to brick, concrete, block, stucco or other masonry material. * Pigmented masonry waterproofer: Pigmented waterproofers are similar to stains and change the color of the masonry material while also providing waterproofing. These products can be applied to any masonry surface. * Film-forming coatings: These masonry products resemble paint finishes—from sheen to satin to gloss. These products resist water pressure behind the film they create when applied. Use film-forming coatings to seal leaky basement walls. As masonry sealers, these products typically last the longest.    Wood and masonry waterproofers:  * Clear, multi-surface waterproofer: Used on both wood and masonry to stop water damage. They do not include mildewcides, pigments or UV blockers. If you apply this product to wood, it turns a weathered gray over time.    ## How to Waterproof Wood  !Person applying sealer to a wood deck.  Correctly weatherproofing wood will make your wood surfaces last longer. Although waterproofing wood will last for a while, it needs to be reapplied every few years to keep its moisture resistance. Here’s how to weatherproof wood:   * Clean the surface: The first step in how to weatherproof wood is to clean the surface. A clean surface ensures a better seal. Use a general cleaner to remove dirt, mold or mildew. Let the wood surfaces dry completely before proceeding to the next step. If it’s a new wood surface, you can skip the cleaning process. * Sand down wood: After the surface is dry, give it a good sanding with rough sandpaper or with a sander to tackle any imperfections. Finish with finer sandpaper to make it smooth and even. Wipe the surface thoroughly to remove}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Waterproof Wood and Masonry (part 3)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{any sanding residue. * Choose the right stain or sealant: Most sealants and stains are sold for the application you need it for. Pick the one that makes sense for your surface. * Apply the first coat: Apply the sealant or stain evenly with your brush or sprayer. Allow the surface to dry for four to ten hours, depending on the product's instructions. * Sand the surface: To form an effective waterproof barrier, you will have to apply multiple coats of stain or sealant. Sanding between coats will allow the next layer to adhere better. Use very fine sandpaper or “0000” steel wool to sand the surface. Wipe the surface down again with a dry cloth to prepare it for the second coat. * Apply the next coat: Add another layer of stain or sealant and let it dry for four to ten hours. Sand and apply waterproofing again, if necessary. * Let it cure: The wood needs to cure for around three days before using it or placing any furniture on top of it.       Safety tip: Always wear protective eyewear, rubber gloves, and other protective apparel while applying waterproofers.  ## How to Waterproof Masonry  !Person applying sealer to a basement.  Exposure to moisture can be damaging for brick, stone and concrete. For many homes, masonry walls are on the exterior or in basements. They are moisture barriers between the outdoors and your interior walls. Fortunately, it's easy to protect masonry surfaces – and the interior of your home – by waterproofing them. Here’s how to waterproof masonry:  * Identify existing water damage: Look for white chalky streaks on concrete blocks or walls. These are actually calcium salt deposits or efflorescence that water brings to the surface. This must be removed before applying a new coat of sealant. Remove efflorescence by washing with a stiff brush and water. If that doesn't work, add in a mild cleaning detergent. * Look for holes and cracks: If there are no holes or cracks in the surface, it's ready for waterproofing. If a surface shows signs of damage, repair the holes or large cracks before applying waterproofer. * Remove existing paint: If there’s paint or other coatings on the masonry, remove it by scraping, sandblasting, sanding, wire-brushing, pressure washing, chemicals or a combination. You can use paint stripper and remover to expedite the process. Masonry sealant only adheres to bare masonry. You have to remove the paint before applying the sealer. * Clean the surface: Use a pressure washer or cleaning solution to remove mold, mildew}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: How to Waterproof Wood and Masonry (part 4)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{and dirt from the surface. Allow it to completely dry. * Repair the surface: Repair hairline cracks with waterproofing mix. Repair larger cracks by cleaning out and patching with mortar. * Mist the area: Finely spray the masonry before applying waterproofer. * Apply the sealant: Paint masonry surface with a thick coat of sealant. Be sure to push the sealant into cracks and crevices of surface. A paint roller or brush made specifically for masonry is best. * Let it dry: Allow to dry overnight or for a minimum of 12 hours between coats. * Apply a second coat: Apply another coat of sealant and allow it to dry. * Paint: Now you can paint the surface any color you want.

When the time came to upgrade our kitchen and dining room floors, LifeProof Sterling Oak 8.7 in. x 47.6 in. Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring from The Home Depot was the clear choice for us. Allow me to share some reasons why!  !In store LifeProof flooring display  Because of the seemingly endless amount of choices out there, shopping for flooring can be a daunting task. With that said, you can count on The Home Depot to provide expert knowledge and insight that’s only a click, phone call or short drive away. In addition to my research online, The Home Depot’s large LifeProof flooring display really helped me make a great flooring decision for our family.  We are a large family that includes four very energetic kids ranging from 11 to 4. When it comes to the needs of our family, health is the number one concern. When I discovered that LifeProof Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring has no phthalates or formaldehyde, it went to the top of my list of choices.  Like most families with kids, we are also a family of spills! Drink spills happen every day, all day for us. Sometimes, these spills aren’t reported to mom and dad. We find out about them when we discover the bottom of our socks are wet.  !A family sitting on LifeProof flooring boxes  Our new LifeProof Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring, which is exclusive to The Home Depot, is 100% waterproof, which gives mom and dad assurance that we won’t have to deal with warped floors every time a drink is knocked over. Clean-up is as simple as using a dust mop, vacuum, or a pH-neutral cleaner. It’s also scratch-resistant, which is nice. But we fully expect to deal with marks and scratches from our VERY active kiddos.  ## Easy LifeProof Install  !A person installing LifeProof flooring  Having installed both hardwood and}}<|eot_id|>"}

I can tell you that this flooring is very easy to install!  These floating/interlocking planks have the underlayment already attached to them and no acclimation is required.

I’m a table saw kinda guy, so I chose to use my saw with a Diablo laminate-cutting saw blade. Be sure to also pick up a Roberts Pro Flooring Installation Kit which makes installing this flooring even easier.  !LifeProof floor plank and carpet   The Zamma Vinyl Multi-Purpose Reducer Molding is another great item to pick up to give a finished look to your new floors next to your existing carpets.  ## The Final Look  !A kitchen and dining room with LifeProof flooring  !Kitchen cabinets and LifeProof flooring  Our rooms feel fresh, new, and lighter thanks to the great color and look that these vinyl planks provide.

Over time, the space can become cluttered, disorganized and an eyesore. A tidy mudroom with plenty of storage options improves its function and looks better overall. Read on for creative mudroom ideas for every room and decor inspiration.   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  What is a Mudroom?  2. 2  Mudroom Organization Ideas  3. 3  Front Entrance Mudroom Ideas  4. 4  Mudroom Ideas for Garages  5. 5  Laundry Room Mudroom Ideas  6. 6  Mudroom Flooring Ideas     See More  ## What is a Mudroom?  !A young girl takes off her boots in an entryway mudroom.  What is a mudroom in your home? As the name suggests, it is an entryway where the wet clothes and mud-covered shoes come off.   Today’s mudroom is more than a place for an umbrella stand. It is extra space for storage when the closets and garage fill. With some creativity and imagination, a mudroom renovation can reflect the overall decor of your home and leave an impression on your guests.    ## Mudroom Organization Ideas  !An organized mudroom at the back door of a house.  The look of your mudroom can reflect your home’s unique style, but it must also be practical. Organization is essential in an area of your house where clothing and even unopened mail can accumulate. Here are some tips to consider when updating your entryway:  * Create sufficient shelving that puts bags and carry items out of the way yet keeps them accessible. * Install locker-style storage areas to create individualized spaces for supplies, equipment and outerwear. * A shoe station for wet or mud-caked footwear is highly functional for a mudroom.    ## Front Entrance Mudroom Ideas  !A roomy hall tree placed next to a front door in the entryway.  A mudroom at the front of the house needs to look great whether it's full or empty. The perfect solution is a beautiful hall tree that includes doors and cubbies filled with baskets. Or if your front entry is cramped, choose a stylish coat rack. Pair your coat rack with these storage superstars:  * Wall-mounted storage hooks are a space-saving option to hang things. * Wall-mounted shelving is suitable for storing bags and boxes and for decorative displays that attract the attention of visitors.    ## Mudroom Ideas for Garages  !A well-organized mudroom placed in a garage.

A garage mudroom offers a bit more space to move around than in an attached mudroom. Creating a mudroom within a garage is also popular as a DIY project. Get creative with your garage storage ideas:  * Go with a matching set of garage storage shelving, track systems and cabinet systems in the corner of your garage. * Use a few plastic storage containers of different colors and sizes to hold coats and bags. * Lay down large area rugs to keep the dirt out of your house. Install cabinet shelving for work clothes, tools and other items you use for your yard work.    ## Laundry Room Mudroom Ideas  !A mudroom built into a laundry area.  The laundry room has great potential as a mudroom. The presence of a washer and dryer can limit the space. However, with some creativity and imagination, you can convert this utility space into a comfortable, functional transition area.  * A small hall tree can store your coats and shoes without taking away the space for your detergent and clothes hampers. * Add vertical shelving and cube storage to take advantage of narrow entry space. * Try cabinetry for larger laundry room spaces. Wood cabinets are functional in the mudroom and can add to the overall decor.    ## Mudroom Flooring Ideas  !Dramatic tile flooring installed in a narrow mudroom.  The flooring in your mudroom should withstand water, dirt and excess debris and be easy to clean. Durability and visual appeal are important factors to consider when choosing the best flooring type for your mudroom. There are a variety of tile and vinyl options that complement your existing interior themes while offering the strength and moisture-resistance you need.   Tip: Consider adding a rug with a slip-proof backing for extra protection on wet and rainy days. Indoor/outdoor area rugs are easy to clean and can be used year-round.  ## Mudroom Storage Ideas  !Cube storage on a bookshelf placed next to a door.  There are many possibilities for mudroom storage options. Consider any combination of the following to keep this area neatly organized:   * Cube storage or cube organizers offer a versatile place for things like shoes, sporting gear, pet supplies and more. Use cube storage in conjunction with bins and drawers to conceal items. * Mudroom cabinets and entryway lockers work for all your outdoor and seasonal essentials. * Trunks are designed specifically for concealed storage.

You can take advantage of the small mudroom in your home or apartment with a few creative options. Try these small mudroom ideas to make the best use of the limited space.   * Try converting an underused closet in the entryway into efficient mudroom space. Remove the door and door hinges. Mount cube storage or wicker-style baskets at eye level for keys, gloves and other small items. * Side chairs are versatile furniture pieces designed to complement any part of your home. They’re a great option in smaller mudrooms that cannot accommodate longer benches. * Install decorative storage hooks at different heights for umbrellas, clothing, coats and hats.    ## Small Mudroom Bench Ideas  !A bench in a mudroom with a cushion for comfort.  Having a proper seat in your mudroom makes it easier to put on and remove shoes and outerwear when you enter and exit. Here are a few popular options:  * Storage benches built of wood are multifunctional by design. Most are built with lids to offer additional storage. * Upholstered benches are cushioned for comfort. Some feature a back for added support. Others have built-in cube storage for shoes and boots. * Benches with attached drawers hide stored items from view and double as a seating area.    ## Mudroom Wall Decor Ideas  !Striking wall art hung next to to a hall tree in a mudroom.  Enhance the aesthetic of your mudroom and make it tie into the rest of your home with:   * Wall art and retro-inspired art are small touches that can make a large impact. * Flush-mount lighting comes in a variety of styles and finishes. Choose lighting that will make a standout impression or subtly enhance the current lighting in your mudroom.    Go beyond decorative wall pieces to create a truly inviting mudroom environment with mirrors.   * Add warmth by placing small pillows in any seating areas. * Take advantage of any natural light with potted plants. The greenery will brighten up the space.    The mudroom is more than a functional part of the house. Use some imagination to transform this small space into one that is organized and useful.

While remodeling her kitchen she promised to let everybody know the steps she took. That was the beginning her her blog Remodel la Casa. She lives in Germantown, Maryland with her husband and two children.   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Step-by-Step Walk-In Shower Install  2. 2  The Before  3. 3  Step 1: Demolition  4. 4  Step 2: Add Extra Space  5. 5  Step 3: Retrofit Plumbing  6. 6  Step 4: Curb or Curb-Less Shower     See More  ## Step-by-Step Walk-In Shower Install  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  I spent the past several years remodeling our plain, cookie cutter home by adding character to most of the rooms with paint, moldings and a few builds. Very slowly, but surely, I’ve updated every single room except for one: our master bathroom. It is the only room in our house I left untouched since the moment we moved in almost 20 years ago!  However, waiting so long to renovate this room gave me the opportunity to define the most important features I wanted to include in the new and improved bathroom. For instance, I wanted to add more storage, install more lights, ditch the annoying shower curtain and above all, get rid of the bathtub and complete a walk-in shower install.  We have lived with a bathtub all this time and never once used it! Although, there is a bathtub in our kids bathroom and it will be staying as my daughter loves to take baths. Besides, it’s recommended that your home has at least one bathtub for home resale purposes.  Check out the following seven steps we took to transform this bathtub/shower combo into the walk-in shower our older-selves are going to enjoy!  ## The Before  Here is our old bathroom: a bathtub that had seen better days, square tiles that only reached six feet up the wall, a shower head that kept fighting gravity and a missing soap holder that got damaged when the suction cup mirror gave up and collapsed on it.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  ## Step 1: Demolition  A great way to stretch your budget is by tackling the demolition yourself – if you do it the right way. I demo’d the entire bathroom myself and let the pros work on the projects that were challenging.  After turning off the water supply and disconnecting the}}<|eot_id|>"}

The plastic bathtub was easily removed by disengaging the clips that secured it to the wall studs.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  ## Step 2: Add Extra Space  If you haven’t thought about adding extra space just yet, this might be a good moment to consider how to add it now that you can see what’s behind the sheetrock. One extra foot of space taken from the attic or a contiguous room/closet would make a big difference in your shower. Alternatively, you can add a sitting bench or a storage niche on the wall.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  We were lucky to grab 16 inches from the attic space to accommodate for a sitting bench, plus six extra inches at the top of that same back wall to create a shower niche.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  ## Step 3: Retrofit Plumbing  You can install a simple shower using the same pipes and drain you already have in place; however, the possibilities are endless if you want to upgrade or add some extra fixtures. There is a great variety of shower systems in the market for you to choose from ranging from style, finish, special features and price.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  For our modern + a-bit-of-vintage-look bathroom, I chose the Delta Vero series single function pressure balanced shower system with shower head andhand shower.  When ordering all the materials for this bathroom renovation, I had no idea what valves and extra parts I needed to buy to install the shower head and handheld shower. A simple e-mail to the Delta Faucet customer service a was all I had to do to get answers. In less than 24 hours I got a list with all the parts the plumber needed on installation day!  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  ## Step 4: Curb or Curb-Less Shower  An important decision you have to make when planning your walk-in shower is choosing the type of floor you want to install – and I’m not talking about materials, which is something else you need to decide later on.  For the floor of your shower or “shower pan,” there are two basic options:  * A curb design, which is the one you must step over as you enter the shower or, * A curb-less design where the shower and the surrounding bathroom floor are at the same level.    Curbed designs are easier and cheaper to install than curb-less, and they work better than its counterpart at keeping the water inside the shower.  Curb-less}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Six Step Walk-In Shower Install (part 3)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{designs are trickier to install but give the entire bathroom a sense of openness. A great option for small bathrooms because there are no transitions on the way to the shower.  A curb-less design can be achieved by raising the entire bathroom floor, or by lowering the shower pan.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  We chose a curb-less design, raising the entire bathroom floor and building the drainage slope below the level of the surrounding bathroom floor.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  ## Step 5: Install the Tile  With thousands of options to choose from, picking the right tile for your bathroom is not an easy feat.  This is one of the aspects of the remodel that will give your bathroom the style of your dreams, or you can go with a neutral palette if you’re thinking about resale value.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  For our master bathroom we took a timeless approach by using the Metro Hex Matte White with Black Dot Porcelain Tile on the floor and the simple Daltile 3 x 6 Subway Ceramic Tile that we brought all the way to the ceiling.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  Finally, the sitting bench was topped off with a beautiful quartz slab.  I also gave the ceiling a planked treatment using Arauco Radiata Pine Ship Lap Boards. See complete instructions on how you can install ship lap on the ceiling on my website.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  We finally installed the shower fixtures after completing the tile work. All I have to say is they are the jewelry this room needed. The champagne bronze color is so striking!  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  The Delta Vero 1-Handle shower is equipped with Touch Clean soft, rubber nubbins (spray holes) that allow you to easily wipe away calcium and lime build-up with the touch of a finger.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  I love the Delta Vero’s fixtures easy-to-clean design and the fact that it maintains a balanced pressure of hot and cold water, even when operating either one of the fixtures.  ## Step 6: Install a Shower Glass Enclosure  This Premium 3/8 (10 mm) tempered safety Glass Warehouse Frameless Fixed Shower Door was installed to keep the water where it’s supposed to stay and to make the bathroom look bigger and brighter. It’s the final addition to the walk-in shower that gives the entire bathroom a fresh and modern feel.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  The shower niche is one element that I highly recommend in a shower. That mean, no more suction cups holding stuff! Its streamlined}}<|eot_id|>"}

It was extra work, but those 16 inches of space make a huge difference when we use the shower.  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  Sticking to a neutral palette gives me the option to play with decor in whatever color I want. Because yeah, I also like color!  !Six Step Walk-In Shower Install  We love how spacious our walk-in shower feels! Now we have plenty of space for all our bathing products and there are no road blocks for us getting into the shower. The best decision we made in this entire bathroom renovation was without a doubt, getting rid of the bathtub.

Finding the balance between style, storage and space is the best way to make a small space seem larger. Living in a small apartment doesn’t mean giving up on interior design! Use these small apartment ideas to transform your space into a chic and cozy home.   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Multi-Purpose Furniture  2. 2  Consider Furniture Size and Shape  3. 3  Use Your Space Vertically  4. 4  Delineate Open Spaces  5. 5  Use Color Well  6. 6  Add Mirrors     See More  ## Multi-Purpose Furniture  !Beige ottomans with removable tops.  In a small space, every inch counts. Instead of trying to make an existing piece work in your space, focus on buying pieces that will work with you. Some types of multi-purpose furniture to consider are:  * A trundle bed that can be folded into a sofa. * Futons are a great space-saving option and are perfect when you need a place for guests to sleep. * A storage ottoman can be used for seating and storage space. * A dining table with a built-in leaf allows you to expand table space only when you need it.    ## Consider Furniture Size and Shape  !A round glass dining table on a blue area rug.  The biggest challenge in decorating a small space is the size of furniture. Most furniture is designed to fit into homes. However, with the popularity of tiny homes, there are plenty of options available to furnish your tiny apartment.   * Avoid over-stuffed styles. Large, bulky furniture will make your space look smaller. Stick with smaller, space-saving furniture pieces. * Use a round dining table. It takes up less space and gives you plenty of seating. * Use curvy furniture. Curvaceous furniture will keep your space from looking monotonous. Compliment the curves in the furniture with similar shapes in your accessories.    ## Use Your Space Vertically  !A flat screen television mounted on a wall.  Make the most of the square footage in your space by going vertical. Here are small-space ideas to save floor space in your apartment:  * Hang wall sconces for light in lieu of table and floor lamps. * Hang shelves next to the bed instead of a bedside table. * Mount your TV on the wall instead of placing in on a media stand. * A mounted wall desk or shelf takes up less room. * Using hanging organizers in the closet to carve out extra storage space.    ## Delineate Open Spaces  !A living room with leather chair and sofa.

{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Small Apartment Ideas (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{may seem like a good idea for a small space, but it can be overwhelming to the eye and look like clutter. Instead, separate areas and give each area a specific purpose. Some ways to delineate a space with limited walls include:  * Use an area rug. A large area rug helps define zones in your layout. Plus, they add texture and interest to a space as well as enhance flooring or carpet. * Use furniture to divide your space. The back of a sofa, a large bookcase or shelving unit and a buffet all make great dividers between spaces. * Use curtains or drapes. Curtians are an inexpensive way to divide a space.    ## Use Color Well  !A bed with white linens.  A light, neutral color palette will make your small space appear larger. That doesn't mean your space has to be void of any color.   * Add a variety of textures. This will keep the space from falling flat. * Focus on three colors. Pick two light and bright shades to dominate the majority of the space. Add one darker accent color for visual interest. * Add pops of bold color. Throw pillows and other accessories are quick and inexpensive ways to add color.    ## Add Mirrors  !A well-accessorized entryway with table and chair.   Perhaps the oldest interior designer trick ever is to use mirrors to make a space feel larger, lighter and airier.   * Use multiple mirrors. One mirror will do the trick, but multiple mirrors will offer visual interest as well as open up a space. Group identical mirrors into a pattern or go for a more eclectic look and hang mismatched mirrors in no particular order. * Add a long, floor-length mirror to make the room feel taller. * Add a long, horizontal mirror to make the room feel wider.    ## Declutter and Storage  !A bedroom with an open closet.  Nothing makes a space feel smaller than clutter. Keep clutter at bay with these tips:  * Limit what you bring in and have a purpose for each object that makes into the apartment. * You don't need to display everything at once. Instead, swap out your accessories seasonally. * Store papers, magazines or other objects you don't need daily inside pieces of furniture with built-in storage. * Make an effort to go through your stuff once or twice a year to reevaluate what should be kept. * Get creative with storage and buy furniture pieces with built-in storage. This will help you keep things organized without taking up additional floor space.    Making your small apartment work for you is an exciting opportunity to build a space to truly call home.}}<|eot_id|>"}

Whether you’re refreshing a space or prepping for a full-blown makeover, it’s important to plan what the space will look like, what type of paint to use for the area (is it a high traffic area like an entryway or a low traffic area like a hallway or closet). Other things to consider is looking at inspiration photos online to narrow down the look you’re going for. I personally like to create a rendering of how the area will look using similar colors I have in mind before diving into the project. This helps me to focus on the task at hand while prepping and building out the space.  ## Prepping the Space  !A person prepping a space.  If your entryway is as old as mine with no defined corners, rough walls from unsanded joint compound or holes in the wall - you may want to fix this issue before painting. For the corners, I opted to fill the area with joint compound then add drywall tape to help define the corners - it comes flat with an option to crease and it’s so easy to use.  !A person fixing a wall.  For the rest of the space I opted to skim coat the walls, which is essentially putting a thin layer of joint compound on the walls to make them even and smooth. I used an all purpose joint compound that I mixed with water to give me a yogurt consistency, then used a putty knife and a wider taping knife to smooth things out. Once I was done with the room, I left the door leading outside slightly ajar to get good circulation so the joint compound could dry.  !A person sanding a wall.!A person pouring paint into a tray.  Once the joint compound had time to dry, I sanded the wall smooth then painted all of the walls with drywall paint - this will prevent any paint on top from peeling off and showing the joint compound layer. Once that was dry, I made an accent wall and looked into paint colors for this high-traffic area, specifically formulated to withstand kids, pets and susceptible to more wear and tear than other areas in the home.  ## Choosing the Correct}}<|eot_id|>"}

When choosing a paint for your project, you have to ask yourself a few questions before you begin: ● What kind of coverage are you looking for? A paint that has one coat coverage or two or more? ● What color are you painting - are you painting a light paint over the primer or a darker color? ● What type of durability do you need? If you need the paint to withstand frequent cleanings/scrubbings, that will factor into the type of paint you need to purchase including the finish. Behr makes highly rated paints with value at every price point, so everyone can transform their space into the look they want with an array of colors to choose from, including custom color match options.  !A person painting an area.

For this space, I opted to use semigloss for the doors, trim and accent wall and satin for the rest of the walls (these semi-gloss and satin finishes are also easy to clean).

I actually purchased a few sample paints for the accent wall and it actually was able to cover the walls without having to purchase a pint.

Published October 28, 2024  Stairs can be more than just a way to connect floors in your home. They can be simply practical, with no flourishes or decorations. On the other hand, some staircase designs are works of art. Most homes have something in between. If you’re planning to spruce up your stairs, this guide offers staircase remodel ideas and staircase design inspiration.  ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Staircases 101  2. 2  Staircase Design Ideas  3. 3  Modern Staircases  4. 4  Staircase Kits and Parts  5. 5  Staircase Remodel Ideas     ## Staircases 101  !Diagram of a staircase with the main parts labeled.  Before discussing staircase ideas, it’s useful to understand the general staircase structure and the stair parts.  * Stringer: This long board frames and supports the staircase. There are two stringers, each running the length of the stairs on each side. The wall stringer is secured to the wall, and the other one is called the outer stringer. The stringer may also be hidden by a skirtboard for decoration. Floating stairs may not have stringers at all.  * Treads: These are the part of the stairs that you step on.  * Risers: When you’re walking up your staircase, and your toe hits a vertical board, this board is called a riser. It’s a vertical piece that’s between each tread. Risers aren’t included for floating staircases, so that vertical space is left empty.  * Handrail/Banister: You hold on to this part of the stairs. Sometimes there is one handrail, and sometimes there are handrails on both sides of the stairs.  * Newel posts: These are vertical pieces at the bottom and the top of a staircase. The handrail is attached to the posts.  * Baluster: Most stairs have vertical spindles or thin pieces that run the length of the stairs between the newel posts. They add stability and also work to keep bigger items from falling off the stairs on the sides. The handrail is also attached to balusters.     Note: Make sure you understand the local building codes before starting any staircase remodel or new installation.  ## Staircase Design Ideas  !A straight staircase leading down to a living room.  Staircases come in a variety of styles. Each shape takes up differing amounts of horizontal space. Shape also affects how easy or difficult it is to use the stairs.  * Modular: Modular staircases are pre-made stairs that make installation more straightforward.

There are often kits that include pre-made, modular spiral staircases to make building them easier.  * Other stair shapes: Stairs can also come in other shapes, whether they’re modular or built from scratch. Some of the shapes include, straight, L-shaped, U-shaped, winder and curved.     ## Modern Staircases  !A spiral staircase in a living room with a fireplace.  The classic or traditional staircase design is usually associated with wood and intricate details. The wood, handrails and balusters are often highly decorated. Traditional staircases also tend to have curves as opposed to straight lines, runners instead of bare stairs, and well-designed newel posts at the lower and upper ends.  Modern staircases tend to include glass or metal materials in their design, and they often feature straight lines throughout. They focus on simplicity instead of elaborate design elements. Design elements that exist are usually more innovative, often being both decorative and useful. Space is also maximized physically and aesthetically. Modern staircases generally take up a small amount of physical space, but they’re designed to appear open and airy.  When looking for modern staircase ideas, look for elements like floating stairs, metal spindles and built-in lighting.  ## Staircase Kits and Parts  !Staircase parts being assembled.  If you want to build a DIY staircase, choose from a variety of staircase kits to make the job easier. Each kit includes the needed parts, so you only need to supply tools and any extras for decor and style. Modular staircase kits have various shapes, including spiral, straight and various turns.  ## Staircase Remodel Ideas  !A person installing new treads onto a staircase.

There are so many ways that you can update your space and give it a little flavor. Today, I’m going to walk you through three ways that you can update a space in your home to give it a whole new feel.  First, we start out with our blank canvas. Pick a room or a space that you’d like to change and utilize one or all of the following ways to update your space.  ## Adding Shiplap Paneling  !A person securing paneling to the wall using a brad nailer.  I always love using shiplap paneling to update a space because it’s a quick and easy way to bring depth to a room. I headed over to my local Home Depot to get my shiplap paneling and then cut it down to size to fit within my office cabinets. The great thing about your local Home Depot is that they can cut down your boards for you, if you don’t have the proper saw to do so at home.  !The empty space with wall paneling.  I secured the paneling to the wall by using two-inch brad nails and a brad nailer. For extra strength, feel free to also use some paneling adhesive.  !An overview of the wall prior to the paint.  Once I installed the shiplap paneling, I went through with wood filler to fill all the nail holes and used caulking to fill all the cracks at the top and bottom. Once all the nail holes were filled, I used a primer to paint the paneling to prepare it for paint.  ## Everyone Needs a Little Color  !Two phone screens that showcase the app capability to see the paint virtually.  Adding color is hands down my favorite way to update a space because it’s the cheapest way to make a space look totally different. I knew I wanted to go bold in here, so I decided to go moody.

I decided to choose this awesome green color called “Classic Bronze” and it really made my office cabinets pop. I utilized my Graco X5 Sprayer to spray the cabinets because it always gives me that nice finish I’m looking for.  ## Jazz It up With Wallpaper  !A wall with wallpaper and two framed paintings.  Wallpaper is another fun way to really make a statement with your space. I personally love going bold when it comes to wallpaper. I had this fun idea to add wallpaper to the shelves of my office cabinets. The Home Depot has so many wallpaper options to choose from and they have a wallpaper calculator that helps you calculate just how much wallpaper you need.  After seeing the wallpaper close-up, I decided to add it to a blank wall instead of adding it to the shelves, so I was able to add the wall measurements to the wallpaper calculator and figure out just how much I needed for this project.  ## Styling Your Space  !An angled view of the completed office space.  Once you finish updating your space, it’s time to style it. I was able to grab some fun items to bring my office space to completion.

{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Types of Carpet Cleaners (part 1)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{!thumbnail  Published September 6, 2023  Carpet is the one area in your house that experiences foot traffic, pets and year-round use. Vacuuming is the first step in keeping carpets clean. Other types of carpet cleaners also help remove stains and bacteria.   There are many options available. It can be tricky to figure out which is the best carpet cleaner for you and your household. If you live with children or own pets, the type of carpet steam cleaner you choose will be different from a single-person household. This guide will teach you what features to look for when you’re ready to buy or rent your next carpet cleaner.   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Things to Consider  2. 2  Best for Pets  3. 3  Best for Area Rugs  4. 4  Best Portable Carpet Cleaners  5. 5  Keeping Carpets Clean     ## Things to Consider  !A woman cleans stairs with an extension hose attached to a carpet cleaner.    Narrowing the types of carpet cleaners for your home comes down to your needs and lifestyle. Consider these ideas before your start your search:   * New Home or New-to-You Home: If you move into a new home, don’t assume the carpet is clean and move-in ready. We recommend a deep carpet cleaning session. This will remove excess debris from construction, foot traffic or previous residents. * Rent vs. Buy: If you live in a large household with children or pets, purchase a carpet cleaner you can use at any time. For those in smaller households with less storage and less foot traffic, or those who rent their home, renting home carpet cleaners may be a great option. * Tools, Accessories and Features: If you have a lot of furniture, area rugs or stairs, choose a carpet cleaner with accessories. An extended hose, upholstery tools and crevice tools are all helpful. Consider additional features like separate tanks for water and floor cleaning products. These eliminate the need for manual-mixing and can save time. * Maintenance: A carpet cleaning machine must also be cleaned. The machines with removable brushes, tools and hoses are easier to maintain than those that you need to lift, turn upside down or reach deep inside of to clean. * Tank-Size: The larger the tank, the more space you can clean with your machine. It will decrease the amount of times you will need to change out the water. * Proper Ventilation: Even the best home carpet cleaners can be loud, and some cleaners can also exude fumes. Be sure to open a window while cleaning and always wear ear protection.    ## Best for Pets}}<|eot_id|>"}

Owning a pet means unwanted stains and shedding. We recommend deep cleaning your carpets at least once a year. Here are the top features to keep in mind when you’re searching for the best carpet cleaner for pets:   * Cleaning Power: You want to look for a machine with a powerful motor. Deep cleaning machines will also double as pet odor and stain removers. * Large Tank: A larger tank means the machine can handle more cleaning solution. It will also cover larger areas and make your job easier. * Accessories: Look for machines that feature extra tools, like vacuum brushes that can remove pet hair from the carpet.    These deep cleaning machines tend to be larger and a bit more costly than smaller options. However, the investment could help ensure savings on re-carpeting the house.   ## Best for Area Rugs  !Two carpet cleaners sit near an area rug.   Certain area rugs, like hand-knotted, wool and antiques, cannot be put in the washing machine. These must be hand-washed or professionally cleaned. Investing in your own carpet cleaner to treat area rug stains can help save time and money in the long run. Keep these key features in mind when looking for the best rug cleaner:   * Good Water Extraction: This will lead to speedier drying time so you won’t saturate the small area and can put furniture back faster. * Moving Brushes: Dirt can seep into fibers and area rugs can hold everything from crumbs to foot-traffic stains. A machine with a brush will lift out crumbs and any other debris that may be trapped in area rug fibers. * Ease of Use: Because you aren’t tackling a large rug or area, consider a lightweight machine that is easy to push around and lift.    ## Best Portable Carpet Cleaners  !A woman carries a portable carpet cleaner.   Whether you live in a small space or need to freshen up the interior of your car, a portable carpet cleaner is a relatively inexpensive way to ensure your carpets are clean and germ-free. Here are the features to look for in a handheld carpet cleaner:   * Stores Easily: Look for a machine that can fit in the trunk of a car, garage shelving or a corner of the laundry room. * Tools: These machines are small, but their tools should be mighty. The attachment options should brush up pet hair from sofas, extract stains from carpet and remove dirt from car floors. * Ease of Use: Certain machines will offer a hands-free option so you can simply plug it in and watch it work.

Choosing the right floor care and keeping a consistent cleaning schedule is important. This can mean the difference between keeping a carpet soft and clean or having to replace it often.   * Deep-clean carpets every 12 to 18 months to keep them fresh and in good shape. For larger households, or those with pets and children, it may be beneficial to clean carpets twice a year. * Cleaning carpets weekly or bi-weekly with handheld or upright carpet cleaners will help keep them clean and fresh. * The best carpet steam cleaner or best carpet shampooer for your home will depend on the level of cleaning you prefer. A carpet shampooer will treat the surface of your carpet. A carpet steam cleaner uses heat to extract the dirt from the fibers.

Published August 29, 2024  The living room is the heart of your home, and selecting types of couches or sofas for it is a major decision. This piece of furniture provides a central location to socialize, read or unwind. You can also use sofas and couches to customize your home’s look and style, fine-tuning your search by size, fabrics or specific features. Read on to find information to help you choose the ideal sofa.   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Couch Vs. Sofa  2. 2  Couch and Sofa Sizes  3. 3  Types of Couches and Sofas  4. 4  Couch and Sofa Styles  5. 5  Types of Couch Fabrics and Materials  6. 6  Choosing A Couch or Sofa    ## Couch Vs. Sofa  !Dual image with black couch on left and gray sofa on right.  Today, \"couch\" and \"sofa\" usually refer to the same items. However, the term “couch” may mean a more casual, small, comfortable, armless piece. Meanwhile, “sofa” may convey a larger, less comfortable, more formal or antique piece used for sitting or hosting guests.  ## Couch and Sofa Sizes  !Woman measuring top of couch cushion with tape measure.  Once you start shopping, you must determine the proper couch sizes. Take measurements of both the couch’s size and its intended room. Look for types of sofas that roughly fit these measurements, if not slightly smaller. This will ensure you leave yourself enough room to easily move around the new couch.  * A three-seat sofa: These allow three individuals to comfortably sit side by side. Typically, they measure between 72 inches and 96 inches, with 84 inches being the average. * Longer or bigger sofas: Taller people may prefer these pieces, measuring 87 inches to 100 inches or more in length. * Smaller sofas: Also called “apartment sofas,” they have less depth and length, which is great for smaller spaces. * Loveseats: Designed for two people, they measure between 48 inches and 72 inches, typically averaging about 52 inches to 66 inches. You may want to pair a loveseat with a couch, arranging them in an L-shaped configuration in your living room. Manufacturers typically classify loveseat dimensions like larger sofas.    Here are helpful measurement terms for your search.  * Sofa depth: This measures the piece front to back. Most types of couches run 32 inches to 40 inches in depth, with 35 inches being the average. * Sofa height: This measures the distance from the couch top to the floor, usually 26 inches to 36 inches. It determines if your feet will}}<|eot_id|>"}

It usually runs 15 inches to 20 inches, averaging 17 to 18 inches. * Seat depth: This measures the seat’s front to either its back edge or the sofa back. As this can affect posture, people of average height may prefer standard seat depths of 21 inches or 22 inches. Deep-seat sofas, with depths of 28 inches to 35 inches or more, are also available.    ## Types of Couches and Sofas  !Gray track-arm couch with ottoman.  When choosing from among the diverse types of sofas, some research may be needed. There are many models to consider, ranging from fancy, formal antiques to comfortable, laid-back favorites. A standard sofa or couch should comfortably seat 3 to 4 people.

When sofa shopping, you need to consider construction. The materials used should mesh with your home’s look and style. Materials can also determine such matters as the piece’s comfort, function, longevity and ease of cleaning. Less durable fabrics may be more susceptible to stretching and staining. Compared to looser weaves, tighter fabric weaves are also less prone to snags and more water-repellant.  One way manufacturers measure durability is a rub-count rating. A machine rubs back and forth until the material wears down, resulting in a numerical rating. A count of 100,000 is considered “high-performance,” while 80,000 is “premium.” A 50,000 count is “standard,” and ideal for high-traffic households. Anything above 25,000 is designated “fine.”  Look for these fabrics and materials in your search:  * Velvet: Luxury fabric. Offers softness and durability. * Suede: A stylish, comfortable and}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Types of Couches and Sofas (part 5)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{durable fabric. Cleaning requires more effort. * Leather: Popular, sophisticated and long-lasting. Available in many colors and textures. Leather sofas and couches are easily cleaned, with stain-resistant finishes. Consider vinyl, a synthetic, more durable and cost-effective alternative. * Twill: A tightly woven cotton fabric. Soft, casual and durable. Easily cleaned. * Boucle: A looped yarn fabric. Soft, nubby texture. Stylish, casual and fun. Easily maintained. * Textured weave: Soft and nubby like boucle, but chunkier and stronger. Offers an attractive, natural feel. Works well in busy homes. * Linen: Provides a soft texture cool to the touch. Simple clean-up. * Cotton: Good, breezy linen alternative. Can be treated and resist stains. * Denim: A durable cotton alternative. Absorbs stains and colors faster. Resists pilling, the breakdown of fabric fibers, which causes small fuzzballs. * Canvas: Another durable cotton alternative. Offers a more casual and relaxed style. * Chenille: Has a soft, silky and plush feel, like velvet. Durable, unless exposed to direct sunlight, so place sofas away from windows. * Wool and wool blends: Durable, with little wrinkling or piling. Easily spot-cleaned or vacuumed. Recommended for homes with children. Good heat retention. * Acrylic: A synthetic wool. Resists wear and tear, fading, wrinkling and discoloration. * Polyester: A non-allergenic, synthetic fiber that looks and feels like leather. Polyester sofas and couches can resist stains and damage more than some natural materials. Alternatives include nylon and olefin, which resist stains and damage.    ## Choosing A Couch or Sofa  !Couple shopping, with man pointing at yellow sectional couch.  You can simplify and organize your sofa search by following these guidelines:  * Take accurate measurements of your available space, including where the couch will sit, and the entire room. * As these are the maximum dimensions, consider a smaller sofa to ensure space for flow and ease of movement. * Keep in mind any nearby windows, rugs or furniture, like accent tables or coffee tables. Electronics and related pieces, like TV stands, may also need to be moved. * Consider the ideal number of seats for your household members and all sizing dimensions. * Research common styles and types of sofas to meet your needs and preferences. Before shopping in a physical location, check if a model is available. * Determine the couch’s functions and uses, such as a formal complement or a place}}<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Types of Flooring (part 1)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{!thumbnail  Last updated March 26, 2024  Each type of flooring material has its own unique benefits. To choose the best types of flooring for your home, first assess the needs of each room. From there, you can select between the wide range of flooring options by matching your style preferences to the size of your budget. This guide reviews several different types of flooring and their pros and cons, so you can find the best type of flooring for every room in your home.   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Types of Vinyl Flooring  2. 2  Types of Tile Flooring  3. 3  Types of Laminate Flooring  4. 4  Types of Hardwood Flooring  5. 5  Hybrid Resilient Flooring  6. 6  Carpet Flooring     See More  ## Types of Vinyl Flooring  !Vinyl plank flooring installed in a living room.  Vinyl flooring is extremely durable and cost-effective. It’s made from plastic, usually consisting of acrylic, PVC and similar polymers. It's a budget-friendly option for homeowners who want luxurious style and commercial grade durability. Vinyl flooring is available in planks, sheets or tiles. Since it is scratch- and stain-resistant and waterproof, vinyl flooring is both functional and stylish.  * Vinyl flooring requires a higher upfront investment, but ideal for heavy traffic areas like kitchens and hallways. It's also easy to install. * All types of vinyl flooring are available in many different color options. * Vinyl can be installed in rolls or in a variety of different shapes, sizes and install methods. These install methods include adhesive, peel-and-stick and click-lock. Vinyl can also be installed directly over most existing floors. * Vinyl finishes include no-wax, urethane or enhanced urethane. Each offers stain-resistance and a nice shine that does not require polishing or buffing. * When shopping for your vinyl flooring, keep the wear layer in mind. This is the top surface of your flooring, usually made of a clear, polyurethane coat. The wear layer makes the flooring waterproof, scratch- and/or stain-resistant. Thickness ranges between 4 to 40 millimeters, with a thicker wear layer making more sense for homes with pets, kids and high traffic. * Luxury vinyl plank flooring is made to look like hardwood, and vinyl tile flooring is made to look like high-end stones such as marble. Sheet vinyl flooring can look like wood, stone, slate or other materials.    ## Types of Tile Flooring  !Patterned vinyl flooring installed in a small bath.  Tile flooring is perfect for high-moisture rooms}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Types of Flooring (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{that have the potential to get wet, like bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms and basements. Tiles are versatile and can last for many years with little maintenance required. Many tile textures are available that can mimic wood, stone or even fabric.  * Ceramic tile is made from clay and is durable enough for most rooms of the house. It has a softer, more comfortable walking surface compared to other types of tile flooring. * Porcelain tile is fired at a higher temperature than ceramic tile, making it more durable, less porous and even more water-resistant than ceramic. However, it’s also more expensive per square foot than ceramic tile. * Natural stone tile includes granite, marble, slate and other materials that have an elegant appearance. These tiles can be expensive and sometimes less durable than other types of tile. * Other types of tiles include mosaic glass, metal, cement and engineered tile. Engineered tile is created with limestone, bits of marble and other materials like epoxy. * Tile flooring can work perfectly in kitchens and bathrooms, but it is also more tedious to install. Certain stones, like marble and slate, require extra care and can stain, scuff or chip easily.    ## Types of Laminate Flooring  !Laminate flooring that looks like wood is installed under a king-sized bed.  Laminate flooring delivers the look of real wood, tile or stone flooring at budget-friendly price. However, laminate usually requires less maintenance than these traditional types of flooring. Scratch-resistant, waterproof, noise-resistant and heated options are available in a variety of attractive, easy-to-install styles. For these reasons, laminate flooring has become a popular choice in many homes.  * Laminate comes in planks, tiles or squares that feature an interlocking tongue-and-groove assembly. This simplifies installation. * Grain styles of laminate wood flooring mimic the look of pine, maple, cherry, oak and other hardwoods. * Other styles of laminate replicate the look of stone, marble, limestone, slate and travertine. * Durable laminate flooring options hold up well. They're ideal for wet bathroom floors, kitchen spills and wear and tear from pets.    ## Types of Hardwood Flooring  !A dining room featuring a warm, hardwood floor.  Hardwood flooring is durable and provides a timeless, elegant look. Certain types of hardwood floors can be refinished up to five times, and you can change the sheen to match a newly decorated room. Area rugs make easy, attractive}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Types of Flooring (part 3)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{additions to rooms with hardwood floors. While hardwood flooring requires a higher upfront investment, many homeowners choose it for its longevity and beauty. You can opt to install hardwood flooring on your own or save time by hiring professionals to install your new flooring.  There are two basic types of hardwood flooring. Solid hardwood flooring consists of boards milled from a single piece of solid wood. Engineered hardwood flooring consists of a multi-layer base (made of compressed wood, resin and polymers) with real hardwood on the surface. It can be more budget-friendly than solid hardwood.  * Hardwood is available in many different types of wood, such as red oak, white oak, cherry, walnut, hickory and maple. Natural hardwood options require regular maintenance and care to preserve their natural appearance. * Many engineered hardwoods now have waterproof, scratch and dent-resistant options. These choices are ideal for high-moisture areas like kitchens and bathrooms, as well as busy areas like hallways. Families with children and pets can also benefit from these types of hardwood flooring choices.    ## Hybrid Resilient Flooring  !A child paints on paper while sitting on a hybrid resilient floor that looks like wood.  Hybrid resilient flooring is low-maintenance, durable and waterproof like vinyl flooring but with the versatile looks of hardwood or stone. It's made of multiple layers and has a vinyl top layer that's resistant to scratches and stains.  ## Carpet Flooring  !A patterned carpet is installed under furniture in a sitting room.  Carpet is of course a great choice for rooms where you want extra warmth and comfort underfoot, such as bedrooms and family rooms. Choose your type of carpet based on the room's level of foot traffic, as some carpet textures and piles are more durable than others. There are a few primary types of carpet and a wide variety of materials available.  * Cut pile carpet fibers are cut so that the tops of each fiber is a tuft. The fibers can be various heights, twisted or cut at different angles. Some examples include frieze pile, saxony, textured, plush and cable. * Loop pile carpet fibers are complete, uncut loops. They include berber, level loop, multi-level loop and sisal. * Cut and loop pile carpets are a combination of these two types of fibers. The textured effect is often a patterned design. * Carpet tiles are also called modular carpets or carpet squares. As the name suggests, the individual pieces are small}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Types of Flooring (part 4)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{shapes, often squares, but they can also be custom designed shapes. Carpet tiles create a variety of visual effects.    ## Other Types of Flooring  !Flooring featuring a wood look.  When it comes time to update your home, you're not just limited to the different types of flooring material mentioned above. Here are some other types of floors to consider when making upgrades:  * Bamboo flooring is often included in hardwood flooring and is comparable to hardwood's warm, attractive appearance. It’s sustainable and eco-friendly as well as durable and strong. Bamboo comes in a variety of shades, needs little maintenance and is budget friendly. * Rubber flooring is available in sheets and tiles that come in multiple colors. Rubber blocks sound and resists moisture, and it's often used in garage flooring. * Gym flooring, typically made of rubber or foam, is available in interlocking tiles or rolls of sheeting. This type of flooring is created to withstand the wear and tear of gyms and high traffic. It withstands water, reduces noise and absorbs shock.    Keep in mind that the best flooring materials for your home will depend on your lifestyle and budget. The wide variety in the different types of flooring materials available provide on-trend, water-resistant and easy-to-clean options.

Published July 7, 2024  Lamps come in such a plethora of styles that you will be able to find the perfect one for your living room or any other space in your home. Before you start your search for the right lamp, though, you should know all the options available to you. This guide will detail the many types of lamps, lamp styles and lamp materials so that you can find the perfect type of lamp for your living room and beyond.   ## Table of Contents  1. 1  Table Lamps  2. 2  Bedside Lamps  3. 3  Buffet Lamps  4. 4  Tripod Table Lamps  5. 5  Candlestick Lamps  6. 6  Task Lamps     See More  ## Table Lamps  !A table lamp sits on an end table next to a sofa.  Table lamps are designed to sit on top of other pieces of furniture, including end tables, dressers, vanities and shelves. Although many table lamps are versatile, the type of table lamp will usually determine its best location in your home. A table lamp’s purpose is usually more defined than that of a floor lamp.   Below is a list of the common types of table lamps and their uses.   ## Bedside Lamps  !A lamp sits on a wooden bedside table next to a bed.  Also known as end table lamps, bedside lamps primarily serve as decorative accents and add low lighting. These lamps can be used in any room, not just the bedroom, and cast a soft, atmospheric glow.   ## Buffet Lamps  !Two buffet lamps sit on a white dresser.   Buffet lamps are traditionally placed on dining tables and sideboards to illuminate a dining room during a meal, but they can be placed anywhere that needs more focused light than what the usual bedside lamp offers. These lamps are long and slender and are often paired with a bell-shaped lamp shade to cast light downward.   ## Tripod Table Lamps  !A tripod table lamp sits on an end table next to a grey sofa.  Tripod lamps are end table lamps with a three-leg construction. This style of lamp fits best with contemporary home decor.  ## Candlestick Lamps  !A white candlestick on a side table.   Often considered a kind of buffet lamp, candlestick lamps are tall, thin lamps. The bases resemble candlesticks in holders. Candlestick lamps can serve as permanent alternatives to candle centerpieces on dining or serving tables, or they can be a great option as a space-saving living room lamp.  ## Task Lamps  !An arc task lamp lights a white office desk.  Task lamps, or desk lamps, are designed to provide targeted task lighting. They cast focused, downward}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Types of Lamps for the Living Room and More (part 2)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{light to illuminate workspaces and will often have adjustable bases or arms so that you can direct the light as needed.  ## Banker Lamps  !A banker lamp sits on a desk in a home office.  Also called piano lamps, banker lamps are known for their squat silhouettes and downward-facing, oblong shades. The height and position of banker lamps typically cannot be adjusted, but these lamps cast a wide range of light that is perfect for studying or writing at a desk.  ## Swing-Arm Table Lamps  !A swing-arm table lamp sits on a white desk.  Swing-arm table lamps have an extended arm that can be pivoted to adjust the position of the light. These lights are excellent on end tables and beside chairs and sofas for comfortable, well-lit reading.  ## Gooseneck Desk Lamps  !A gooseneck desk lamp on a home office desk.   Gooseneck desk lamps are task lamps with long, flexible necks. Most often found on work desks, these lamps are useful and versatile lights to have because their adjustable necks point light in any direction.  ## Floor Lamps  !A floor lamp lights the corner of a living room.  Floor lamps are freestanding and can be placed anywhere in a room so long as an electrical outlet is nearby, which makes them adaptable and a popular choice of lamp. A standard or traditional floor lamp will have a tall, straight pole that extends from a single base. They are usually paired with a cone- or bell-shaped lamp shade that casts gentle, downward light.  Below is a list of the common types of floor lamps and their uses.   ## Task Floor Lamps  !A task floor lamp extends over a small table.   Task floor lamps are similar to their table lamp counterparts but have the added benefit of being placed anywhere in a room without a desk or table. These floor lamps will typically have downward-casting LED lights and a flexible, curved neck that you can adjust as needed.  ## Arc Floor Lamps  !An arc floor lamp lights up a contemporary living room.  Arc floor lamps or arched floor lamps have a graceful curve that grants them an extended reach. They may have multiple curved arms with lights on each. Arc floor lamps are ideal for placing beside or behind chairs and sofas where you need extra illumination.  ## Tripod Floor Lamps  !A tripod floor lamp sits behind a white armchair in a living room.  Tripod floor lamps are popular lamps for contemporary style homes, similar to tripod table lamps. Tripod floor lamps have three legs instead of a single base.   ## Tree Lamps  !A tree floor lamp}}<|eot_id|>"}

Tree lamps have several arms that extend and branch out from the base. Since they have multiple lights, tree lamps can brighten areas more than standard floor lamps and offer opportunities to get creative with your lighting by installing different colored bulbs. Choose these floor lamps when you need light but have limited space for a lamp.  ## Swing-Arm Floor Lamps  !A swing-arm floor lamp illuminates a living room.  Just like swing-arm table lamps, swing-arm floor lamps have a pivotable, extended arm so you can adjust the position of the light.  ## Torchiere Lamps  !A torchiere lamp sits next to an entryway table.   Like a torch, torchiere lamps direct their light upward and outward to brighten a room. These floor lamps look similar to a standard floor lamp, but they have a lamp shade that flares upward rather than downward.  ## Pharmacy Lamps  !A pharmacy lamp in black finish over a modern seating area.   A pharmacy lamp is a type of task lamp that has a rigid yet adjustable arm and a dome-shaped metal shade that directs a focused stream of light downward.  ## Column Lamps  !A column lamp shines brightly next a black sofa and a brick wall.   Column lamps are unique floor lamps that are shaped like a tall and often rectangular tower or column. Column lamps stand out as an art piece and are made for those who want to make a statement with their lamps.  ## Shelf Lamps  !Home decor sits on the shelves of a shelf lamp in a contemporary room.  Shelf lamps combine a lamp and shelf storage to create one functional, space-saving piece of furniture. These lamps are often a type of column lamp, but they can also have a tripod construction with shelves installed between the legs.  ## Chandelier Lamps  !A chandelier lamp sits in front of a dark wall.  These statement lamps are styled after hanging chandeliers and can have impressive hanging crystal pieces, multiple candelabra-style lights and extravagant designs. Chandelier lamps are guaranteed to be eye-catching in the living room or elsewhere.  ## Lamp Sets  !A living room lamp set consisting of two matching table lamps and one floor lamp.  If you are aiming to light a large room or multiple rooms, consider purchasing a lamp set. Lamp sets have at least two matching lamps that are designed to create a cohesive flow in your home. The lamps in the set can be different sizes or colors, alternate designs and any combination of table or floor lamps, but they will}}<|eot_id|>"}

When choosing lighting for your living room and more rooms in your home, you are not limited to the above types of lamps. There many more distinctive types of lamps and unique variations of popular lamp styles. Some lamps defy easy categorization.    Below are a few novelty lamps that can brighten your home in unexpected ways:  Lava Lamps: For a fun retro vibe, incorporate a lava lamp into your home decor. A lava lamp’s colorful glow can add a soothing ambiance to your room.   Himalayan Salt Lamps: Himalayan salt lamps will be both a natural-inspired centerpiece and a helpful tool to have in the winter. Their release of positive ions may help improve your mood.   Moon Lamps: Moon lamps are miniature replicas of the moon that are lit internally. A moon lamp is a mesmerizing decorative piece that you can leave on all night to serve as a night light.   Swag Lamps: A swag lamp is somewhere between a ceiling light and a floor lamp, since it hangs from the ceiling but connects to a wall outlet with a decorative cord. A swag lamp can be hung from anywhere you choose, so long as its cord can reach an outlet.   [Night Lights](/b/Lighting-Night-Lights/N-5yc1vZbmgy): Night lights are small lights that add a bit of light to an otherwise darkened room. They can soothe the room’s occupant as he or she falls asleep or light a path without creating a disturbing amount of light. Usually, night lights are small enough to be plugged directly into a wall outlet.   ## Lamp Materials  !An assortment of contemporary lamps on display in a living room.  The materials of the lamp and lamp shade are two major factors in defining a lamp’s style. Popular lamp materials include wood, brass, ceramic, marble and glass – although many other unique options are available as well.   Wood Lamps: Wood lamps can be subtle and blend in with your existing furniture, or they can stand apart with a vintage or rustic finish. Extremely versatile, wood lamps are a reliable choice for any room in your home.   Brass Lamps: Lamps made from brass can either maintain their warm finish or can have a silver or bronze coating. Depending on the shape and finish you choose, brass lamps can have a striking contemporary look or a refined vintage finish.   Ceramic Lamps: Ceramic lamps are often handcrafted and painted, offering one-of-a-kind designs. These lamps are a great way to add a}}<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>{{Title: Types of Lamps for the Living Room and More (part 5)}}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>{{piece of functional art to your home.   Marble Lamps: To create a powerful statement in a minimalist-style home, choose a marble lamp. Classic yet bold, marble lamps strike the right balance between simplicity and grandeur.    Glass Lamps: If you are trying to make a space feel open and breezy, use a glass lamp. The glass can be tinted or clear, textured or smooth, and still create a feeling of more space, rather than adding to tabletop clutter.  Similarly, lamp shades come in a wide variety of materials, but the most popular lamp shade materials are parchment, silk, linen and laminated card.  Tip: Learn more about choosing a lamp shade from our How to Measure a Lamp Shade guide.  ## Lamp Features  !A desk lamp with a USB outlet that is connected to and charging a smartphone.  Any type of lamp can have additional features that will make them more functional in your home.  Dimmable lamps allow you to adjust the amount of light as needed. This feature can be especially useful for party lighting, watching movies, winding down in the evening or brightening the room for certain tasks.   Some lamps may be smart enabled so you can control them from your smart phone or other electronic devices, while other lamps may turn on and off with just a touch of your hand.  Smaller task lights may not even require an electrical outlet and can instead be powered and charged through your computer’s USB port. Alternatively, many modern desk lights also have USB ports for charging other devices.  Lamps help create the mood and aesthetic in your home. It's worth shopping around to find ones that truly compliment your home. Lamps are incredibly versatile and varied, so be sure to explore all the types of lamps available to you through The Home Depot to find the perfect one for your home.
