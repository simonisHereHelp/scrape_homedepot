It won't drip or run, allowing for more precise application and reducing the likelihood of it spilling onto the floor or furniture.\n- Gels are often effective in removing wallpaper that has been applied to unprimed drywall or used clay-based adhesives. A good gel should liquefy the adhesive without softening or soaking the face of the drywall.\n- Use a spray bottle, brush or roller to apply and let sit for 20 to 30 minutes so it can soak in.\n- After the gel has soaked the wallpaper, use a scraper to peel up the wallpaper in strips."}

Other things to consider is looking at inspiration photos online to narrow down the look you’re going for. I personally like to create a rendering of how the area will look using similar colors I have in mind before diving into the project. This helps me to focus on the task at hand while prepping and building out the space."}

The wood, [handrails](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Building-Materials-Moulding-Millwork-Stair-Parts-Stair-Railings-Handrails/N-5yc1vZ2fkpaac) and balusters are often highly decorated. Traditional staircases also tend to have curves as opposed to straight lines, runners instead of bare stairs, and well-designed newel posts at the lower and upper ends.\n- Modern staircases tend to include glass or metal materials in their design, and they often feature straight lines throughout. They focus on simplicity instead of elaborate design elements. Design elements that exist are usually more innovative, often being both decorative and useful. Space is also maximized physically and aesthetically. Modern staircases generally take up a small amount of physical space, but they’re designed to appear open and airy.\n- When looking for modern staircase ideas, look for elements like floating stairs, metal spindles and built-in lighting."}

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 3: Types of Waterproofers\n- [Wood sealers](/b/Paint-Exterior-Wood-Coatings-Exterior-Wood-Sealers/N-5yc1vZaqux): Oil-based stains penetrate the wood more deeply than water-based finishes. Water-based products are easier to clean and can be applied to dry or damp wood.\n- Clear waterproofer for wood: These products are specifically designed for wood and usually include mildewcides and help wood resist fading. Clear waterproofers enhance the natural wood grain’s appearance. Reapply every one to two years.\n- Tinted waterproofer for wood: Contain mildewcides and offer greater UV protection because they contain pigment. The color or tint enhances the wood color and allows the wood grain to show through. Reapply every two to three years.\n- Clear [masonry sealer](/b/Sealer/Concrete-Brick-Masonry-Stone/N-5yc1vZ1z0o7h6Z1z0oepl): Masonry sealers do not provide true waterproofing, but they do repel water and allow water vapor to move through the material. Apply these products to brick, concrete, block, stucco or other masonry material.\n- Pigmented masonry waterproofer: Pigmented waterproofers are similar to stains and change the color of the masonry material while also providing waterproofing. These products can be applied to any masonry surface.\n- Film-forming coatings: These masonry products resemble paint finishes—from sheen to satin to gloss. These products resist water pressure behind the film they create when applied. Use film-forming coatings to seal leaky basement walls. As masonry sealers, these products typically last the longest.\n- Clear, multi-surface waterproofer: Used on both wood and masonry to stop water damage. They do not include mildewcides, pigments or UV blockers. If you apply this product to wood, it turns a weathered gray over time."}

Water-based products are easier to clean and can be applied to dry or damp wood.\n- Clear waterproofer for wood: These products are specifically designed for wood and usually include mildewcides and help wood resist fading. Clear waterproofers enhance the natural wood grain’s appearance. Reapply every one to two years.\n- Tinted waterproofer for wood: Contain mildewcides and offer greater UV protection because they contain pigment. The color or tint enhances the wood color and allows the wood grain to show through. Reapply every two to three years.\n- Clear [masonry sealer](/b/Sealer/Concrete-Brick-Masonry-Stone/N-5yc1vZ1z0o7h6Z1z0oepl): Masonry sealers do not provide true waterproofing, but they do repel water and allow water vapor to move through the material. Apply these products to brick, concrete, block, stucco or other masonry material.\n- Pigmented masonry waterproofer: Pigmented waterproofers are similar to stains and change the color of the masonry material while also providing waterproofing. These products can be applied to any masonry surface.\n- Film-forming coatings: These masonry products resemble paint finishes—from sheen to satin to gloss. These products resist water pressure behind the film they create when applied. Use film-forming coatings to seal leaky basement walls. As masonry sealers, these products typically last the longest.\n- Clear, multi-surface waterproofer: Used on both wood and masonry to stop water damage. They do not include mildewcides, pigments or UV blockers. If you apply this product to wood, it turns a weathered gray over time."}

Wedge the spade under the tiles and “shovel” to break them up.\n- Older tile can be firmly attached to the subfloor and very difficult to remove. Consider renting a jackhammer with a chisel when removing a tile floor. Be especially careful to wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from the flying tile and mortar chips."}

{"prompt": "You are a procedural assistant trained to guide users through technical SOPs step-by-step with clarity and context.\n\n### User:\nI’ve completed Step 10. What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 11: Using a Paint Sprayer\n- When picking a paint, it should flow smoothly through the sprayer. Airless paint sprayer rentals use oil-based paints. They’re better than latex or water-based paints, which can be thicker and clog machines.\n- Have all necessary painting tools and equipment ready before starting a project. Besides the normal materials, you may need special items. For instance, a fiberglass twin stepladder or scaffold set may help for higher walls and ceilings. If you have to paint large, open indoor areas, such as warehouses, The Home Depot has scissor lifts for rent that can rise up to 40 feet.\n- Be sure to follow the sprayer’s operations manual for all steps. Practice first, using a piece of scrap drywall or cardboard. This will allow you to use the sprayer correctly, using a smooth, back-and-forth motion. You can also figure out the distance needed for proper coverage.\n- Always begin your stroke movement before using the trigger to release paint. Then, end the stroke after releasing the trigger. Doing this prevents paint from building up on the surface. Regularly wiping your paint sprayer nozzle with a rag prevents clogging.\n- When using a sprayer, first paint corners and complex areas. You can then move on to flat surfaces, working top to bottom.\n- Once your project is completed, let the paint dry for 24-48 hours. Next, remove the painter’s tape and drop cloths. You can then move your furniture back into the room and continue designing.\n- Make sure you return your paint sprayer rental clean. When finished, clean the entire paint sprayer, as per the operations manual. If work remains, pour the leftover paint back into the can and clean the machine before storing."}

Test the solution on a hidden area of grout to be sure it won’t discolor.\n- Pour the solution over a small area of stained grout lines. It's best to work in small sections and make more solution as needed.\n- Allow the cleaner to sit for up to 15 minutes to give the ingredients time to work, then scrub and rinse until all the cleaner is removed. Use firm pressure and make several passes over each grout line.\n- Assemble and load the steam cleaner according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Use only water. Do not add additional chemicals or cleaning solutions to the cleaner’s water tank.\n- Once the machine has heated up, turn on the steam function and apply the cleaning brush to the dirty areas of grout.\n- Use a rag or mop to thoroughly dry up the residual water after steam cleaning.\n- Steam cleaning can remove grout sealant along with dirt and mildew.

For the corners, I opted to fill the area with joint compound then add drywall tape to help define the corners - it comes flat with an option to crease and it’s so easy to use.\n- ![A person fixing a wall.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/2TCBEXCWqnTycYma0fclIg/pV8cCuhOfgFpvBBq2wrieA/optimizedFile/NickellMorgan-SimplyHandmade-2023-ColorAuthority-SmallEntrywayRefresh-Photo17.jpg)\n- For the rest of the space I opted to skim coat the walls, which is essentially putting a thin layer of joint compound on the walls to make them even and smooth. I used an all purpose joint compound that I mixed with water to give me a yogurt consistency, then used a putty knife and a wider taping knife to smooth things out. Once I was done with the room, I left the door leading outside slightly ajar to get good circulation so the joint compound could dry.\n- ![A person sanding a wall.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/bKfVT7XKdQsj42VH2MSd5Q/AefGkk9xPFHFCak124VHwg/Original%20file/NickellMorgan-SimplyHandmade-2023-ColorAuthority-SmallEntrywayRefresh-Photo15.jpg)![A person pouring paint into a tray.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/JSCv0xydnxHz2W-HuStBlw/kNECs7fYhyUeEqDHywjw4g/optimizedFile/NickellMorgan-SimplyHandmade-2023-ColorAuthority-SmallEntrywayRefresh-Photo2.jpg)\n- Once the joint compound had time to dry, I sanded the wall smooth then painted all of the walls with drywall paint - this will prevent any paint on top from peeling off and showing the joint compound layer. Once that was dry, I made an accent wall and looked into paint colors for this high-traffic area, specifically formulated to withstand kids, pets and susceptible to more wear and tear than other areas in the home."}

Typically, they measure between 72 inches and 96 inches, with 84 inches being the average.\n- Longer or bigger sofas: Taller people may prefer these pieces, measuring 87 inches to 100 inches or more in length.\n- Smaller sofas: Also called “apartment sofas,” they have less depth and length, which is great for smaller spaces.\n- Loveseats: Designed for two people, they measure between 48 inches and 72 inches, typically averaging about 52 inches to 66 inches. You may want to pair a loveseat with a couch, arranging them in an L-shaped configuration in your living room. Manufacturers typically classify loveseat dimensions like larger sofas.\n- Sofa depth: This measures the piece front to back. Most types of couches run 32 inches to 40 inches in depth, with 35 inches being the average.\n- Sofa height: This measures the distance from the couch top to the floor, usually 26 inches to 36 inches. It determines if your feet will rest on the ground.\n- Seat height: This measures the distance from the top of a couch’s seat cushion to the floor. It usually runs 15 inches to 20 inches, averaging 17 to 18 inches.\n- Seat depth: This measures the seat’s front to either its back edge or the sofa back. As this can affect posture, people of average height may prefer standard seat depths of 21 inches or 22 inches. Deep-seat sofas, with depths of 28 inches to 35 inches or more, are also available."}

If you don't use primer, they can absorb paint unevenly. You might end up adding more coats of paint than you planned to.\n- On walls that are already painted with a glossy finish, or when using latex paint on top of an oil-based finish, a new coat of paint applied directly on top might have trouble adhering without a coat of primer for it to hold onto.\n- When painting over a dark-colored wall, a coat or two of primer provides a clean and neutral canvas for a lighter paint color to refresh your room.\n- Primer is typically less expensive than paint. Using primer instead of several coats of new paint may lower the cost of your paint job.\n- Primer works well to cover previous paint colors and flaws or spots on the wall. But if your walls are in great shape and the new coat of paint is a similar color to the old one, you may not need primer."}

Remember to leave room for them to grow and don’t crowd too many into the container.\n- Use a spoon or your fingers to make holes for the plants in the potting soil.

When deciding between an air vs. an airless paint sprayer, consider the following:\n- [Airless paint sprayers](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Sprayers-Airless-Paint-Sprayers/N-5yc1vZartt) are used by skilled novices and professionals for large surfaces, such as interior walls and house siding. This type of sprayer uses pressurized force to deliver a large volume of paint quickly. Airless spray painting can deliver paint at a rate of a half gallon to 2 gallons a minute. Choose an airless sprayer if using a paint sprayer does not require much precision work to complete a big job.\n- [HVLP paint sprayers](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Sprayers-HVLP-Paint-Sprayers/N-5yc1vZciky) are suitable for detailed applications that require accuracy and a smooth finish. These types of paint sprayers use air flow and paint volume controls for fast and even paint delivery. The output of paint from HVLP paint sprayers can cover large surfaces quickly. They are also effective for touch-up work. Choose a standing or a lightweight, stationary model of an HVLP sprayer to avoid arm fatigue.\n- [Pneumatic paint sprayers](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Sprayers-Pneumatic-Paint-Sprayers/N-5yc1vZc9nr) use compressed air. They can apply a greater volume of paint than airless and HVLP sprayers. They are used for precision application of paint in detailed commercial and industrial work, such as motor vehicle body parts."}

However, laminate flooring consists of a synthetic veneer over a particleboard core. Its veneer is printed to resemble wood but is not actually wood. Laminate flooring has a shorter lifespan than either engineered or solid hardwood, lasting between 15 to 25 years or sometimes longer with proper care. Some people choose laminate over wood flooring because of its low cost per square foot and superior resistance to daily wear and tear."}

Painting tile is much easier than installing tile.\n- You won’t have to take out the old tile or figure out how to dispose of it.\n- Getting ready to paint tile includes making minor repairs to your existing tile, which can improve its appearance.\n- Paint doesn’t last as long as the finish on tile. The paint you apply may come off over the years. Paint might not be the best option for high traffic tile, such as floors.\n- Similarly, painting tiles in a shower, painting tiles in the bathroom, or painting any other tiles that get wet often may be inefficient.\n- When you paint tile, the grout will be painted over, too. You’ll no longer see the contrast between the grout and tile.\n- You need to do a thorough job of cleaning and repairing the tile before you get started.\n- While the paint dries, you may not be able to use the room the tile is in."}

To follow along with the whole bathroom process, you can check out my blog, [The Creative Mom](https://www.thecreativemom.com/).\n- ![How to Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-01.jpg)"}

California King Size Bed\n- Bedding for king size mattresses, comforters, pillows and other bedding are more budget friendly and come in a wider variety of styles. [Sheet sets](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Home-Decor-Bedding-Bed-Sheets/King/N-5yc1vZc1kdZ1z0zdjr) and duvet covers are 76” x 80”. Comforters are generally around 110” x 96”. Bedspreads are 120” x 118”.\n- Expect to invest more for California king bedding and accessories due their much larger size. [Sheet sets](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Home-Decor-Bedding-Bed-Sheets-Sheet-Sets/California-King/N-5yc1vZ2fkpc4bZ1z0z5i8) and duvet covers are typically 72” x 84”. Comforters are generally around 104” x 98”. Bedspreads are around 120” x 118”.\n- Sleepers: A king size bed provides plenty of comfort for average height couples or individuals who like a lot of space. For taller individuals, a California king bed works best. It can also comfortably accommodate two adults plus children or a pet.\n- Room size and layout: A king size bed requires a room that is at least 12 feet by 12 feet. A California king size bed needs a minimum of 13 feet by 13 feet of floor space. Remember to measure your room twice and factor in any windows and doors."}

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 7: Tile Removal Tips\n- Start by removing a few tiles to see how difficult the project will be.\n- Replacing a few cracked or damaged tiles may be a better plan than replacing an entire floor or wall.\n- If the tiles are relatively loose, try using the floor scraper to remove several rows at a time. Wedge the spade under the tiles and “shovel” to break them up.\n- Older tile can be firmly attached to the subfloor and very difficult to remove. Consider renting a jackhammer with a chisel when removing a tile floor. Be especially careful to wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from the flying tile and mortar chips."}

This year, I updated my Kwanzaa tablescape using the vast selection of globally-inspired products in The Home Depot tableware collection, including hand-carved pieces by African artisans. All featured items are available at The Home Depot.\n- The focal point of my table is the DIY [**stenciled**](https://homedepot.com/p/301126054) table runner. A table runner is a great way to add visual interest to a table without taking away from the other elements present.

If the opening is narrow, put them on a paper plate and fold them into a funnel shape. Put the tip of the funnel into the neck of the container and gently shake the pebbles out. If you don’t have a paper plate, use a few sheets of newspaper. The pebbles will let excess water drain away from the plants. If plant roots sit in water, they won’t get enough oxygen and will die.\n- Put a light layer of activated charcoal chips over the pebbles. Stores that carry pet and fish supplies will likely have this charcoal. It will help absorb odors that can build up over time, especially in closed terrariums.\n- Add a layer of moss over the charcoal to help keep the charcoal from floating when you water the plants. If you can’t reach into the container, fold the moss or tear it into small pieces and drop it in. If you need to move the moss around, use a wooden skewer or a chopstick."}

It's used to help insulate, absorb sound and reduce wear on your floor. It can also serve as a vapor barrier.\n- Floor levelers are cement-based products that come premixed or as dry substances to mix with water. Choose a product recommended for your application and mix it, if needed, following the manufacturer’s directions.\n- Floor patches are products that help repair holes, cracks, small dips and other imperfections. Follow the directions on your product for how to apply it.\n- If the manufacturer recommends it, go over the subfloor with a damp [sponge](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Sponges-Scouring-Pads/N-5yc1vZcb3k) before you apply a floor leveler. This will help keep it from drying too fast, so you’ll have time to spread it around.\n- Pour the liquid-like floor leveler onto the subfloor and smooth it out with a [trowel](/b/Building-Materials-Concrete-Cement-Masonry-Concrete-Tools-Concrete-Trowels/N-5yc1vZaq1d). Gravity will help it settle into the low areas. Remove any excess floor leveler and feather it around the edges so it blends with the rest of the floor. Let the floor leveler dry overnight or as indicated by the manufacturer.\n- After the floor leveler dries, sand down any high spots to make them flush with the rest of the floor.\n- Use a wet-vac to vacuum up dust and debris. Make a final check with a carpenter's level or straight pipe to be sure all the low spots are gone."}

Because they have a sleek, streamlined appearance, floating shelves are ideal for those with a minimalist sense of style, and they’re great for showing off artwork and small pieces of decor.\n- Another one of the most popular floating shelf ideas is using box shelves, which have four sides like a picture frame. This style of floating shelf can be made from different types of wood in varying thicknesses, allowing you to adapt them to your own style and display items of various sizes.\n- When it is time to pick a bracket for shelving, consider what fits into your lifestyle and decor.

Use a scraper or putty knife to loosen an edge of the wallpaper at the corner of a room and carefully try to pull off a strip. Removable wallpaper should peel off easily.\n- Strippable wallpaper is designed to last longer than removable wallpaper, but softens easily when soaked with hot water.\n- Wallpapers designed to be water resistant or washable, such as vinyl wallpapers, need a stronger method, such as a chemical [wallpaper remover](/b/Paint-Wallpaper-Remover/N-5yc1vZ2fkot80).\n- Gel removers are less messy than liquid removers and can be more effective in removing wallpaper that has been applied to unprimed drywall or has used clay-based adhesives.\n- Wallpaper steamers can be used on any wallpaper and may be the only recourse with old, stubborn wallpapers that are hard to remove. Buying or renting a steamer may be more expensive than other methods."}

Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Lifeproof-Sterling-Oak-8-7-in-W-x-47-6-in-L-Luxury-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring-20-06-sq-ft-case-I966106L/300699284) from The Home Depot was the clear choice for us. Allow me to share some reasons why!\n- ![In store LifeProof flooring display](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/lifeproof-luxury-vinyl-plank-flooring-image-2.jpg)\n- Because of the seemingly endless amount of choices out there, shopping for flooring can be a daunting task. With that said, you can count on The Home Depot to provide expert knowledge and insight that’s only a click, phone call or short drive away. In addition to my research online, The Home Depot’s large LifeProof flooring display really helped me make a great flooring decision for our family.\n- We are a large family that includes four very energetic kids ranging from 11 to 4. When it comes to the needs of our family, health is the number one concern. When I discovered that LifeProof Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring has no phthalates or formaldehyde, it went to the top of my list of choices.\n- Like most families with kids, we are also a family of spills! Drink spills happen every day, all day for us. Sometimes, these spills aren’t reported to mom and dad. We find out about them when we discover the bottom of our socks are wet.\n- ![A family sitting on LifeProof flooring boxes](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/lifeproof-luxury-vinyl-plank-flooring-image-3.jpg)\n- Our new LifeProof Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring, which is exclusive to The Home Depot, is 100% waterproof, which gives mom and dad assurance that we won’t have to deal with warped floors every time a drink is knocked over. Clean-up is as simple as using a dust mop, vacuum, or a pH-neutral cleaner. It’s also scratch-resistant, which is nice. But we fully expect to deal with marks and scratches from our VERY active kiddos."}

However, using an orderly process can save time and effort. Painting a room in the correct order will also reduce drips and runs. A good rule of thumb is to always start with the ceiling. Next, paint the walls and end by painting baseboards, windows and door trim.\n- Tip: Maintain efficiency by getting enough paint. A gallon of paint can roughly cover between 250 and 300 square feet of wall space. Determine exactly how much you need with our [paint project calculator](https://secure2.homedepot.com/account/view/calculator/paint)."}

It is comfortable underfoot, while it still creates a sleek, attractive finish to your room. In addition to being moisture resistant, vinyl is also stain resistant and can dampen noise, making it a preferred flooring choice for families with children and pets.\n- For these same reasons, many people choose to install [vinyl plank flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbzjz) in bathrooms and basements.

Place painter’s tape in short, overlapping strips for more control and best coverage.\n- If you have a textured ceiling and are painting only the walls, run a screwdriver along the ceiling's edge. This creates a small, unnoticeable, texture-free surface for the painter's tape to adhere to. It is then easier to create a straight paint edge.\n- If you're painting an accent wall, mask off the inside edge of the wall from the rest of the room."}

[Grain filler](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Patching-Repair-Wood-Restoration/N-5yc1vZ2fkpb13) is a pigmented paste that comes in a variety of colors.

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 11: Pros of Painting Tile\n- Painting tile is a budget friendly alternative to putting in new tile.\n- It’s a DIY project that almost anyone can do. Painting tile is much easier than installing tile.\n- You won’t have to take out the old tile or figure out how to dispose of it.\n- Getting ready to paint tile includes making minor repairs to your existing tile, which can improve its appearance.\n- Paint doesn’t last as long as the finish on tile. The paint you apply may come off over the years. Paint might not be the best option for high traffic tile, such as floors.\n- Similarly, painting tiles in a shower, painting tiles in the bathroom, or painting any other tiles that get wet often may be inefficient.\n- When you paint tile, the grout will be painted over, too. You’ll no longer see the contrast between the grout and tile.\n- You need to do a thorough job of cleaning and repairing the tile before you get started.\n- While the paint dries, you may not be able to use the room the tile is in."}

Make sure you apply a cementitious flooring leveler you can nail through later.\n- Plus, check the hardwood flooring manufacturer’s installation for specific instructions.\n- Leveling a floor yourself is a project you can do. The secret is to take your time and make sure to use the right tools for the job. Got a small flooring project?

However, using an orderly process can save time and effort. Painting a room in the correct order will also reduce drips and runs. A good rule of thumb is to always start with the ceiling. Next, paint the walls and end by painting baseboards, windows and door trim.\n- Tip: Maintain efficiency by getting enough paint. A gallon of paint can roughly cover between 250 and 300 square feet of wall space.

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 8: Paint the Walls\n- Working from top to bottom, roll the paint roller back and forth across the wall in a series of V- or W-shaped strokes. Do this until the section is covered.\n- Before reloading your roller and moving to the next section, roll over the area you’ve just painted. Use a smooth, continuous stroke, going from top to bottom. These smoothing strokes even the coat, catch any drips and help to cover up lines and tracks.\n- Overlap areas already painted. Lightly lift the roller off the wall to avoid leaving end marks. This also lets you seamlessly blend different areas.\n- Frequently remix paint, using a mixing stick or a paint mixing tool. Do this any time you leave your paint sitting for an extended period of time.\n- Wait 2-4 hours for the first coat to dry before applying a second coat.\n- Follow the same process and techniques used when priming walls, blending sections as you work.\n- To prevent paint from drying on the roller, store your paint roller in a plastic bag between coats. This will keep the paint and brush moist between uses.\n- Keep your paint color uniform. Once you’ve used half a gallon of paint, refill that can with paint from a different can and mix together. If you’re doing a large job, mix several gallons into one 5-gallon bucket."}

These install methods  \n- Vinyl finishes include no-wax, urethane or enhanced urethane. Each offers stain-resistance and a nice shine that does not require polishing or buffing.\n- When shopping for your vinyl flooring, keep the wear layer in mind. This is the top surface of your flooring, usually made of a clear, polyurethane coat. The wear layer makes the flooring waterproof, scratch- and/or stain-resistant. Thickness ranges between 4 to 40 millimeters, with a thicker wear layer making more sense for homes with pets, kids and high traffic.\n- Luxury [vinyl plank flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbzjz) is made to look like hardwood, and [vinyl tile flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Tile-Flooring/N-5yc1vZaq27) is made to look like high-end stones such as marble.

The stringer may also be hidden by a skirtboard for decoration. Floating stairs may not have stringers at all.\n- Treads: These are the part of the stairs that you step on.\n- Risers: When you’re walking up your staircase, and your toe hits a vertical board, this board is called a riser. It’s a vertical piece that’s between each tread. Risers aren’t included for floating staircases, so that vertical space is left empty.\n- Handrail/Banister: You hold on to this part of the stairs. Sometimes there is one handrail, and sometimes there are handrails on both sides of the stairs.\n- Newel posts: These are vertical pieces at the bottom and the top of a staircase. The handrail is attached to the posts.\n- Baluster: Most stairs have vertical spindles or thin pieces that run the length of the stairs between the newel posts.

Similarly, you can find engineered hardwood floors that are [dent resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Dent-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z191cs).\n- UV resistant: The finish blocks UV rays from sunlight so the wood color won’t fade.\n- [Waterproof](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Waterproof/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1bmdp): Protect against damage from spills with waterproof or [water resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Water-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1bmb3) flooring.\n- [Stainable](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Stainable/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z181te): Stainable floors allow you to refresh or change the color in the future.\n- [Supports refinishing](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Supports-Refinishing/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1984l): If you want the flooring to last a long time, find engineered hardwood that can be refinished if it gets damaged or worn-looking.\n- Find out if the engineered wood flooring requires an underlayment for installation. [Underlayment](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Flooring-Supplies-Surface-Prep-Underlayment/N-5yc1vZcdtw) is a thin material placed between the flooring and the subfloor. It helps absorb noise, adds insulation and protects both the flooring and subfloor from water damage. It also helps correct uneven subfloors. Most wood flooring requires an underlayment, but some engineered wood floors have an attached underlayment.\n- To choose the color of your engineered hardwood flooring, decide whether you want light, medium or dark toned wood.\n- [Light engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Light/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7p): Light tones brighten rooms and have an airy and open aesthetic. They’re great for minimalist and coastal styles but may show dirt more easily.\n- [Medium engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Medium/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7u): These traditional wood tones match most home decor styles. Medium toned wood floors are the most popular choice with the widest selection of flooring. They can have warm or cool undertones.\n- [Dark engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Dark/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7j): These luxurious wood tones can make rooms feel cozy and welcoming. Dark floors are great for many styles of homes from modern to traditional. Dark wood can include cool, nearly black tones or warm red tones.\n- Alternatively, narrow down your choice by searching for specific color families: brown, red, gray, tan, white, black are some examples.\n- Textured engineered wood flooring already has dents, scuffs and simulated damage of varying degrees on the plank surface. There’s less need to worry about actual damage from daily wear and tear. Plus, textured flooring will need less maintenance than non-textured flooring. Note that if you resurface textured floors, you’ll lose some of its initial texture.\n- [Smooth](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Smooth/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n40): Smooth floors have a sleek and shiny finish that shows a wood pattern without the surface texture. This is a popular choice in many modern homes. Smooth flooring may dent and scuff more easily than textured flooring.\n- [Distressed](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Distressed/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n4s): This texture mimics the appearance of older wood and adds an air of history and lived-in comfort. Distressed floors better hides scuffs and dents. Since it looks like reclaimed wood, this texture is a great option for rustic, industrial or traditional homes.\n- [Wire brushed](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Wire-Brushed/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17ngu): Wire brushed engineered wood adds subtle texture for an elegant, solid hardwood appearance. It blends in perfectly with most styles of homes.\n- [Hand scraped](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Hand-Scraped/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n41): Hand scraped engineered wood has a stronger texture than wire brushed. Hand scraping is usually one aspect of distressed engineered wood floors, since it adds an antiqued appearance. The texture’s irregularity makes the wood look more convincing as solid hardwood. This is a great texture choice for historical, traditional or rustic homes."}

Get started by cleaning the tile thoroughly.\n- Most tile is located in high-use areas such as kitchens and bathrooms where grime or soap scum can build up, so use extra care when painting tiles in a shower, for instance. Use a [commercial cleaner](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Products/N-5yc1vZcb33) and sponge to scrub tiles. Rinse with clear water and allow tile to dry.\n- If needed, apply a degreasing cleaner on kitchen [tile backsplashes](/b/Flooring-Tile/Backsplash/N-5yc1vZar0yZ1z0p5qm) to make sure they are completely clean."}
{"prompt": "You are a procedural assistant trained to guide users through technical SOPs step-by-step with clarity and context.\n\n### User:\nWhat is Step 11 for Painting a Room?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 11: Using a Paint Sprayer\n- When picking a paint, it should flow smoothly through the sprayer. Airless paint sprayer rentals use oil-based paints. They’re better than latex or water-based paints, which can be thicker and clog machines.\n- Have all necessary painting tools and equipment ready before starting a project. Besides the normal materials, you may need special items. For instance, a fiberglass twin stepladder or scaffold set may help for higher walls and ceilings. If you have to paint large, open indoor areas, such as warehouses, The Home Depot has scissor lifts for rent that can rise up to 40 feet.\n- Be sure to follow the sprayer’s operations manual for all steps. Practice first, using a piece of scrap drywall or cardboard. This will allow you to use the sprayer correctly, using a smooth, back-and-forth motion. You can also figure out the distance needed for proper coverage.\n- Always begin your stroke movement before using the trigger to release paint. Then, end the stroke after releasing the trigger. Doing this prevents paint from building up on the surface. Regularly wiping your paint sprayer nozzle with a rag prevents clogging.\n- When using a sprayer, first paint corners and complex areas. You can then move on to flat surfaces, working top to bottom.\n- Once your project is completed, let the paint dry for 24-48 hours. Next, remove the painter’s tape and drop cloths. You can then move your furniture back into the room and continue designing.\n- Make sure you return your paint sprayer rental clean. When finished, clean the entire paint sprayer, as per the operations manual. If work remains, pour the leftover paint back into the can and clean the machine before storing."}

Vinyl planks can be sorted into three main categories based on their installation method: GripStrip, click-lock and glue down.\n- [GripStrip vinyl plank flooring](/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/Grip-Strip/N-5yc1vZbzjzZ1z1ak2p) has a manufacturer-applied adhesive layer that connects the planks to one another. This installation method creates a floating floor, which means GripStrip vinyl planking covers the subfloor without adhering or fastening to it in any manner. Floating floors are an easy, mess-free way to install new flooring without necessarily having to remove the existing flooring.\n- [Interlocking vinyl plank flooring](/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/Click-Lock/N-5yc1vZbzjzZ1z1ajwk), also known as click-lock, creates a floating floor. But instead of having an adhesive connecting the planks, the planks interlock with tongue-and-groove joints that easily snap together for a reliable fit.\n- [Glue down vinyl plank flooring](/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/Adhesive/N-5yc1vZbzjzZ1z1ak5j) adheres to the subfloor using either one of two types of adhesives: hard-set or pressure-sensitive adhesives. Hard-set adhesive is spread along the subfloor, and then the vinyl planks are laid down on top. Pressure-sensitive adhesive is already on the bottom of the plank and bonds to the subfloor when the plank is pressed into place. While both types of adhesives are durable, the pressure-sensitive adhesive can make replacing individual vinyl planks easier.\n- All three installation methods are suitable for novices, require little time and can be laid over any rigid and level subfloor. Which method you choose depends on personal preference and the room you are planning to renovate. When choosing between floating floor options, note that GripStrip vinyl plank flooring is often water-resistant, while click-lock vinyl plank flooring can be entirely waterproof."}

This creates a small, unnoticeable, texture-free surface for the painter's tape to adhere to. It is then easier to create a straight paint edge.\n- If you're painting an accent wall, mask off the inside edge of the wall from the rest of the room."}

Measure the size of the room to determine how much vinyl plank flooring to purchase.

{"prompt": "You are a procedural assistant trained to guide users through technical SOPs step-by-step with clarity and context.\n\n### User:\nWhat is Step 6 for Painting a Room?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 6: How to Prime Walls for Painting\n- Begin by using a high-quality [paint brush](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Brushes/N-5yc1vZarac) to brush paint 2-3 inches along the edge of the wall, windows and corners of a room. This process is known as \"cutting in.\"\n- For best results, work in one small area at a time.\n- You may want to follow the process of \"edging painting.\" This involves cutting in the wall's edges before painting rolling or painting the entire wall. Doing so prevents the borders from drying before you finish painting the wall. It also keeps the sheen uniform. If edging, use an angled brush to apply a thick coat.\n- Choose the right roller cover for your wall surface and place it onto your [paint roller](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Rollers/N-5yc1vZaqpy). For smooth ceilings, use a low nap roller. For a textured ceiling, use a thicker roller, with a 1/2-inch or 3/4-inch nap.\n- Pour primer into a paint tray.\n- Dip the roller into the paint, making sure it’s completely covered.\n- Roll the paint roller over the ridged area of the [paint tray](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Trays-and-Liners/N-5yc1vZaqcd) a few times to remove excess paint.\n- With a fully loaded paint roller, work top to bottom. Roll it back and forth across the wall in a series of V- or W-shaped strokes.\n- Roll in one section at a time, moving from top to bottom and from one side of the wall to the other. The goal is to achieve even coverage, with no drips. Press lightly on the roller to prevent drips and lines.\n- Reload the roller and paint the next section. Cover only as much as you can finish while the primer is still wet. Overlap areas of wet primer only."}

{"prompt": "You are a procedural assistant trained to guide users through technical SOPs step-by-step with clarity and context.\n\n### User:\nWhat is Step 2 for Types of Carpet Cleaners?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 2: Things to Consider\n- New Home or New-to-You Home: If you move into a new home, don’t assume the carpet is clean and move-in ready. We recommend a deep carpet cleaning session. This will remove excess debris from construction, foot traffic or previous residents.\n- Rent vs. Buy: If you live in a large household with children or pets, purchase a carpet cleaner you can use at any time. For those in smaller households with less storage and less foot traffic, or those who rent their home, renting home carpet cleaners may be a great option.\n- Tools, Accessories and Features: If you have a lot of furniture, area rugs or stairs, choose a carpet cleaner with accessories. An extended hose, upholstery tools and crevice tools are all helpful. Consider additional features like separate tanks for water and [floor cleaning products](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Floor-Care-Floor-Cleaning-Products/N-5yc1vZbzju). These eliminate the need for manual-mixing and can save time.\n- Maintenance: A carpet cleaning machine must also be cleaned. The machines with removable brushes, tools and hoses are easier to maintain than those that you need to lift, turn upside down or reach deep inside of to clean.\n- Tank-Size: The larger the tank, the more space you can clean with your machine. It will decrease the amount of times you will need to change out the water.\n- Proper Ventilation: Even the best home carpet cleaners can be loud, and some cleaners can also exude fumes. Be sure to open a window while cleaning and always wear ear protection."}

{"prompt": "You are a procedural assistant trained to guide users through technical SOPs step-by-step with clarity and context.\n\n### User:\nWhat is Step 7 for Engineered Wood Flooring Selection?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 7: Engineered Wood Flooring Materials\n- [Oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11yin): A readily available wood, oak is a commonly used material in engineered wood flooring. Oak is a light-colored wood that has varying undertones. [Red oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Red-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11uq9) has pink undertones, [white oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/White-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z117p3) has yellow and gold undertones and [French oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/French-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z0m8y8) has gray undertones. White and French oak are both slightly tougher than red oak, which is more prone to scratches.\n- [Hickory](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Hickory/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11e6m): An extremely hard and durable wood, hickory is another very popular choice for flooring. It’s more durable than oak, making it a good choice for rooms with heavy traffic. Hickory is a light- to medium-toned wood with contrasting stripes in its natural pattern.\n- [Maple](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Maple/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11xzp): Maple has an even texture and pattern, which makes it a good choice for sleek, stained floors. It’s naturally light-toned but can be stained a wide variety of colors. Note that if you don’t want to stain and finish a floor yourself, most engineered wood floors come pre-stained and finished from a manufacturer. Maple is tougher than oak, but not quite as tough as hickory.\n- [Birch](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Birch/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11dkr): Like oak, birch wood also comes in multiple varieties—yellow birch and red birch. Both varieties are equally as strong and are both more durable than oak. Birch is a good choice for rooms with medium to heavy foot traffic.\n- [Bamboo](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Bamboo-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbrfe): While not technically wood, bamboo makes an excellent flooring material that has the look and texture of real wood. Its strength and durability can vary between manufacturers, but it’s typically more durable than the hardwoods in this list. Bamboo flooring can be refinished, stained and installed just like any other engineered wood flooring. Plus, bamboo is an eco-friendly renewable resource."}

Once we were ready to tile the walls, we put down some cardboard so we didn’t drip thinset on our floor tiles. We used 3×12 [Daltile Subway Tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Restore-Bright-White-3-in-x-12-in-Ceramic-Subway-Wall-Tile-12-sq-ft-Case-RE15312HD1P2/302872669) in bright white for our walls. The price on these tiles was so good! They give a lot of bang for their buck. We started by laying the back wall. We centered our first tile in the center of our back wall, then we tiled out and up from there.\n- You will spread a layer of [thinset](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-VersaBond-White-50-lbs-Fortified-Thinset-Mortar-MTSW50/100091767) with the notched side of your [trowel](https://www.homedepot.com/p/HDX-9-in-x-3-8-in-x-1-4-in-Square-Notch-Economy-Flooring-Trowel-10114X/203713870), then lay your tile. Make to keep the tiles level. Since the shower pan is sloped, you want to make sure you use a [2 foot level](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Measuring-Tools-Levels/N-5yc1vZc1zh), and check every so often to make sure you are keeping your tiles level. We used [1/8″ tile spacers](https://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-1-8-in-Tile-Spacers-1-000-pack-10281Q/100191220) to keep our tiles spaced and even.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-11.jpg)\n- You’ll want to start on the wall you look at straight on, then move to your side walls, that way you won’t see your grout lines. So after we got our first row done on our back wall, we moved to our side walls. Since we didn’t really care if the tiles on those walls were centered, we started with half of a tile and worked our way outward. Then on the next row, we started with a whole tile. We continued that pattern upward."}

When deciding between an air vs. an airless paint sprayer, consider the following:\n- [Airless paint sprayers](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Sprayers-Airless-Paint-Sprayers/N-5yc1vZartt) are used by skilled novices and professionals for large surfaces, such as interior walls and house siding. This type of sprayer uses pressurized force to deliver a large volume of paint quickly. Airless spray painting can deliver paint at a rate of a half gallon to 2 gallons a minute. Choose an airless sprayer if using a paint sprayer does not require much precision work to complete a big job.\n- [HVLP paint sprayers](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Sprayers-HVLP-Paint-Sprayers/N-5yc1vZciky) are suitable for detailed applications that require accuracy and a smooth finish. These types of paint sprayers use air flow and paint volume controls for fast and even paint delivery. The output of paint from HVLP paint sprayers can cover large surfaces quickly. They are also effective for touch-up work. Choose a standing or a lightweight, stationary model of an HVLP sprayer to avoid arm fatigue.\n- [Pneumatic paint sprayers](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Sprayers-Pneumatic-Paint-Sprayers/N-5yc1vZc9nr) use compressed air. They can apply a greater volume of paint than airless and HVLP sprayers. They are used for precision application of paint in detailed commercial and industrial work, such as motor vehicle body parts."}

If you're trying to figure out how to cut vinyl flooring planks, experts recommend scoring the plank with a utility knife and snapping it. Vinyl cutters are a good solution too. For more complicated cuts, consider a jigsaw or miter saw. Other tools you’ll need include measuring tape, a chalk or crayon, a straightedge and a vacuum. Some manufacturers recommend a tapping block and rubber mallet.\n- If you are installing glue-down vinyl planks, make sure you have vinyl floor adhesive\n- and a notched trowel. If your room has a baseboard or moulding at the bottom of the wall, use a pry bar to temporarily remove it.\n- Tip: We recommend using safety goggles and work gloves during installation.\n- Knee pads are also a good idea."}

Begin by measuring the length of each wall and calculating the dimensions for your box trim.\n- Consider factors like spacing and preferred height for each box trim element. For instance, I aimed for a 5-inch spacing gap from walls and baseboards, with a desired lower box trim height of 20 inches.\n- Using these preferences, I calculated the height of the upper box trim by subtracting the total spacing gaps from the ceiling height, minus the height of the lower box trim. This gave me a height of 68 inches for each piece. To calculate the width, subtract the total wall width from the number of spacing gaps, then divide by the desired number of box trim designs.\n- For example, on my 98-inch-wide wall, I wanted two box trim designs. So, subtracting 15 inches for gaps, I divided the remaining 83 inches by two, resulting in 41.5 inches for each box trim width. Apply these width calculations consistently across all walls for uniformity."}

The stringer may also be hidden by a skirtboard for decoration. Floating stairs may not have stringers at all.\n- Treads: These are the part of the stairs that you step on.\n- Risers: When you’re walking up your staircase, and your toe hits a vertical board, this board is called a riser. It’s a vertical piece that’s between each tread. Risers aren’t included for floating staircases, so that vertical space is left empty.\n- Handrail/Banister: You hold on to this part of the stairs. Sometimes there is one handrail, and sometimes there are handrails on both sides of the stairs.\n- Newel posts: These are vertical pieces at the bottom and the top of a staircase. The handrail is attached to the posts.\n- Baluster: Most stairs have vertical spindles or thin pieces that run the length of the stairs between the newel posts. They add stability and also work to keep bigger items from falling off the stairs on the sides. The handrail is also attached to balusters."}

Trying to figure out how much primer you need? A gallon of primer will cover between 250 to 400-square feet of surface. Two coats of primer may be required over heavy stains or tannin-rich wood.\n- Most primers can be tinted to help ensure good coverage for the finish coat.

No adhesive or nails are required, as the flooring simply rests over a subfloor, held down by its own weight. This method works for either wood or concrete subfloors and has the added benefit of allowing you to easily pull up the flooring as needed for repairs or replacement."}

Use a drop cloth to cover the floor. Put painter’s tape on any surfaces and fixtures that you don’t want to get paint on.\n- Whether your goal is to update mosaic tiles for a hallway or painting bathroom tiles with a splash of color, one of the most important steps in learning how to paint tiles is using a primer. [Primers](/b/Paint-Primers/N-5yc1vZbt0t) hide unwanted colors and designs. When you’re painting tile, using bonding primer will help new paint adhere better to the tiles. It can also help keep the paint from chipping and peeling in the future.\n- Working on clean, dry tile, roll the primer evenly over the tiles. Use two coats if necessary, letting primer dry between coats before moving to the next step. If you are hand painting tiles, use a small [paint brush](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Brushes/N-5yc1vZarac) to paint details onto the tiles.\n- As you’re applying primer and painting tile, work safely.

Do this until the section is covered.\n- Before reloading your roller and moving to the next section, roll over the area you’ve just painted. Use a smooth, continuous stroke, going from top to bottom. These smoothing strokes even the coat, catch any drips and help to cover up lines and tracks.\n- Overlap areas already painted. Lightly lift the roller off the wall to avoid leaving end marks. This also lets you seamlessly blend different areas.\n- Frequently remix paint, using a mixing stick or a paint mixing tool. Do this any time you leave your paint sitting for an extended period of time.\n- Wait 2-4 hours for the first coat to dry before applying a second coat.\n- Follow the same process and techniques used when priming walls, blending sections as you work.\n- To prevent paint from drying on the roller, store your paint roller in a plastic bag between coats. This will keep the paint and brush moist between uses.\n- Keep your paint color uniform. Once you’ve used half a gallon of paint, refill that can with paint from a different can and mix together. If you’re doing a large job, mix several gallons into one 5-gallon bucket."}

I used [pre-pasted wallpaper](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Magnolia-Home-by-Joanna-Gaines-The-Daily-Paper-Strippable-Roll-Wallpaper-Covers-56-sq-ft-MH1508/301440074 \"Magnolia Home by Joanna Gaines The Daily Paper Strippable Roll Wallpaper \\(Covers 56 sq. ft.\\)\") which was fairly easy to work with. Simply spray the back with water and like magic, it activates the paste! Start in an inconspicuous corner. The reason for this is that when you have wallpapered the entire room, there is a high probability that the seams will not line up properly between the first piece laid and the last piece. Also, always make sure your first piece is completely level, as it is the template that you will be basing your entire room on. Make sure you get wallpaper smoother and razor blade to smooth it out and cut off excess wallpaper. PRO TIP: Always order EXTRA wallpaper, because running out is no fun! And you can always return any roles that you do not use. For the vertical boards as well as the floor trim, I used one-by-six trim boards. I decided to use my sprayer to spray these all at once. Next, I installed my floor trim in which I used a miter saw to create my 45-degree cuts. After the floor trim was installed, I was ready to install my vertical boards. I highly suggest laying them out before installing them. I used a spare board as a spacer to make sure they were evenly distributed. I like to measure each board vs. cutting them all the same size, because my walls are usually not level. Installing them was simple, I just used my brad nailer!\n- ![A close-up of the wallpaper.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/mXEoZdGXS7QVV1Zm8VfXwQ/5e7TwZ14RfHnjSht0VoxuQ/Original%20file/JordanMiller-JordanMillerHome-FY24HDC-BasementBathroomMakeover-BlogPhoto-12.jpg)"}

Airflow efficiency is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air being moved. Fans either come with a [DC motor](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/DC-Motor/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z0sd38) or an AC motor. DC motors tend to produce less heat and consume less energy than heavier AC motors.\n- Fans with high CFM, or airflow efficiency, are perfect for outdoor spaces or garages because they will circulate more air and can help keep away insects and pests.\n- If energy-efficiency is at the top of your must-have list, look for an [Energy Star rated fan](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans-Ceiling-Fans-With-Lights/Energy-Star/N-5yc1vZcjnuZ1z0ksr7). These certified ceiling fans use up to 20 percent less energy. Energy Star-certified ceiling fans can help reduce your heating and cooling costs.\n- It's important to note that dirty fan blades will not have a high airflow efficiency, so be sure to dust your ceiling fans often.\n- Tip: In the summer, run your fan counterclockwise for a cool breeze. In the winter, run your fan clockwise to push down warm air circulating near the ceiling to better distribute the heat throughout the room.\n- You can change the fan direction using a switch on the motor housing or a button on the fan remote.\n- From learning how to measure for a ceiling fan to finding the best outdoor ceiling fans for your patio, we are here to help.

Put painter’s tape on any surfaces and fixtures that you don’t want to get paint on.\n- Whether your goal is to update mosaic tiles for a hallway or painting bathroom tiles with a splash of color, one of the most important steps in learning how to paint tiles is using a primer. [Primers](/b/Paint-Primers/N-5yc1vZbt0t) hide unwanted colors and designs. When you’re painting tile, using bonding primer will help new paint adhere better to the tiles. It can also help keep the paint from chipping and peeling in the future.\n- Working on clean, dry tile, roll the primer evenly over the tiles. Use two coats if necessary, letting primer dry between coats before moving to the next step. If you are hand painting tiles, use a small [paint brush](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Brushes/N-5yc1vZarac) to paint details onto the tiles.\n- As you’re applying primer and painting tile, work safely. Make sure the area is well-ventilated. Wear a mask, gloves and protective eyewear."}

I designed mine to be 12” wide and 45” long to allow room to display the runner without the place settings overlapping. You can design yours to be longer or shorter.\n- 2. Lay out the [**tablecloth**](https://homedepot.com/p/316712043) on a large, flat surface. Use the [**ruler**](https://homedepot.com/p/100118266) and [**pencil**](https://homedepot.com/p/202263665) to draw lines to mark your selected dimensions. Use [**painter’s tape**](https://homedepot.com/p/100085823) to secure the fabric to your work surface while measuring and cutting.\n- 3. Use [**shears**](https://homedepot.com/p/313485219) to cut along the reference lines to create the shape of the runner.\n- ![Person marking a tablecloth with a ruler and pencil.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/RicheHolmesGrant-TheRicheLife-2022Kwanzaa-DIYRunner-3.jpg)\n- 4. Turn the fabric over so that you can see the stitching. Fold the unfinished edges over to create a ¼” hem.\n- 5. Place the fabric [**tape**](https://homedepot.com/p/302628355) along the unfinished edges; it’s helpful to work in smaller, cut sections of tape (about 8-10 inches) at a time.\n- 6. Peel back the white strip from the fabric tape. Fold the edge over following the indentations from Step 4. Press down to secure the tape.\n- ![Person using scissors to cut a tablecloth.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/RicheHolmesGrant-TheRicheLife-2022Kwanzaa-DIYRunner-4.jpg)![Person peeling back fabric tape from a tablecloth.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/RicheHolmesGrant-TheRicheLife-2022Kwanzaa-DIYRunner-5.jpg)![Person pressing down folded edges of a tablecloth.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/RicheHolmesGrant-TheRicheLife-2022Kwanzaa-DIYRunner-6.jpg)\n- 7. Repeat Steps 4-6 until you have a hem around all of the unfinished edges.\n- 8. Use an [**iron**](https://homedepot.com/p/313868909) to smooth out all wrinkles, including the folded edges, if needed.\n- ![Person ironing a tablecloth.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/RicheHolmesGrant-TheRicheLife-2022Kwanzaa-DIYRunner-7.jpg)\n- 9. Place a drop cloth down or other covering to protect your work surface from the black [**paint**](https://homedepot.com/p/203709348).\n- 10. Squeeze about a quarter of the paint bottle into a disposable bowl.\n- 11. Secure the stencil to one end of the fabric using painter's tape. There’s a triangle in the bottom right corner of the stencil to use a guide when placing it on the fabric; make sure that the triangle is facing up each time that you place the stencil on the fabric to repeat the pattern.\n- ![A tablecloth, stencil, bowl, and paint brush over a measurement board.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/RicheHolmesGrant-TheRicheLife-2022Kwanzaa-DIYRunner-8.jpg)\n- 12. Dip the foam [**brush**](https://homedepot.com/p/100128205) into the paint; be careful not to oversaturate the brush to avoid the paint seeping underneath the stencil.\n- 13. Paint the cut-out sections of the stencil.\n- ![A bowl with paint and a paintbrush on top of a tablecloth.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/RicheHolmesGrant-TheRicheLife-2022Kwanzaa-DIYRunner-9.jpg)\n- 14.

You must open all windows and doors. You should also use fans and proper safety gear, like a [respirator mask](/b/Safety-Equipment-Respirator-Masks/N-5yc1vZc25k) and ventilator.

This process is known as \"cutting in.\"\n- For best results, work in one small area at a time.\n- You may want to follow the process of \"edging painting.\" This involves cutting in the wall's edges before painting rolling or painting the entire wall. Doing so prevents the borders from drying before you finish painting the wall. It also keeps the sheen uniform. If edging, use an angled brush to apply a thick coat.\n- Choose the right roller cover for your wall surface and place it onto your [paint roller](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Rollers/N-5yc1vZaqpy). For smooth ceilings, use a low nap roller. For a textured ceiling, use a thicker roller, with a 1/2-inch or 3/4-inch nap.\n- Pour primer into a paint tray.\n- Dip the roller into the paint, making sure it’s completely covered.\n- Roll the paint roller over the ridged area of the [paint tray](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Trays-and-Liners/N-5yc1vZaqcd) a few times to remove excess paint.\n- With a fully loaded paint roller, work top to bottom. Roll it back and forth across the wall in a series of V- or W-shaped strokes.\n- Roll in one section at a time, moving from top to bottom and from one side of the wall to the other. The goal is to achieve even coverage, with no drips. Press lightly on the roller to prevent drips and lines.\n- Reload the roller and paint the next section. Cover only as much as you can finish while the primer is still wet. Overlap areas of wet primer only."}

Very slowly, but surely, I’ve updated every single room except for one: our master bathroom. It is the only room in our house I left untouched since the moment we moved in almost 20 years ago!\n- However, waiting so long to renovate this room gave me the opportunity to define the most important features I wanted to include in the new and improved bathroom. For instance, I wanted to add more storage, install more lights, ditch the annoying shower curtain and above all, get rid of the bathtub and complete a walk-in shower install.\n- We have lived with a bathtub all this time and never once used it! Although, there is a bathtub in our kids bathroom and it will be staying as my daughter loves to take baths.

Latex primer is considered an all-purpose primer and is easy to clean up with water. [Oil-based primer](/b/Paint-Primers/Oil-Based/N-5yc1vZbt0tZ1z1p6ug) is also versatile. It's the preferred choice for blocking stains, wood tannin and for covering porous wood surfaces.\n- Be sure to have enough paint primer before starting your project. Trying to figure out how much primer you need? A gallon of primer will cover between 250 to 400-square feet of surface. Two coats of primer may be required over heavy stains or tannin-rich wood.\n- Most primers can be tinted to help ensure good coverage for the finish coat. Bright or deep colors require a tinted primer. A store associate will determine the amount of tint to add to the primer following the manufacturer’s specifications and based on the color of the topcoat being used."}

When it drips back down onto the plants, they get another watering, which makes a terrarium very low-maintenance.\n- An open terrarium is just what it sounds like. It’s a container with an opening that lets air circulate. In an open terrarium, you’ll need to add more water from time to time, as it will eventually evaporate, and the soil and plants will begin to dry out.\n- A closed terrarium is a glass container with a lid. It should be opened about once a month to let fresh air in. While it’s open, some of the moisture inside also evaporates, so you’ll need to add a little more water. You just won’t need to water as often as with an open terrarium."}

If the opening is narrow, put them on a paper plate and fold them into a funnel shape. Put the tip of the funnel into the neck of the container and gently shake the pebbles out. If you don’t have a paper plate, use a few sheets of newspaper. The pebbles will let excess water drain away from the plants. If plant roots sit in water, they won’t get enough oxygen and will die.\n- Put a light layer of activated charcoal chips over the pebbles. Stores that carry pet and fish supplies will likely have this charcoal. It will help absorb odors that can build up over time, especially in closed terrariums.\n- Add a layer of moss over the charcoal to help keep the charcoal from floating when you water the plants. If you can’t reach into the container, fold the moss or tear it into small pieces and drop it in. If you need to move the moss around, use a wooden skewer or a chopstick."}

Paint and décor should complement most colors so it’s easy to repurpose the room at any time.\n- Flex rooms that will be multifunctional can use shelves or screens to divide it into sections. Consider painting walls or using decor with colors that complement all sections of the room. This will help it look cohesive.\n- Your flex room can be a spare room in your home, or you may be inspired to build an area.

Remember to leave room for them to grow and don’t crowd too many into the container.\n- Use a spoon or your fingers to make holes for the plants in the potting soil. Add a cork to the end of your skewer or chopstick to make a tamping tool and use it to gently firm the soil around the plants.\n- If you get any soil on the glass, use a small, dry paint brush to remove it.\n- Add another layer of moss around the plants for a finished look or use more pebbles or sea glass. Water lightly with a small watering can or spray bottle. Avoid watering so much that water collects in the bottom.\n- Trying adding small tools, shells or other decorations to your terrarium, if desired. Small children’s toys, like plastic dinosaurs, to make a fun “prehistoric jungle” terrarium.\n- Keep your terrarium out of direct sunlight, so the sun coming through the glass won’t burn the plants.

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 5: How to Waterproof Masonry\n- Identify existing water damage: Look for white chalky streaks on concrete blocks or walls. These are actually calcium salt deposits or efflorescence that water brings to the surface. This must be removed before applying a new coat of sealant.  \n- Look for holes and cracks: If there are no holes or cracks in the surface, it's ready for waterproofing. If a surface shows signs of damage, repair the holes or large cracks before applying waterproofer.\n- Remove existing paint: If there’s paint or other coatings on the masonry, remove it by scraping, sandblasting, sanding, wire-brushing, pressure washing, chemicals or a combination. You can use [paint stripper and remover](/b/Paint-Paint-Strippers-Removers/N-5yc1vZc5bq) to expedite the process. Masonry sealant only adheres to bare masonry. You have to remove the paint before applying the sealer.\n- Clean the surface: Use a pressure washer or cleaning solution to remove mold, mildew and dirt from the surface. Allow it to completely dry.\n- Repair the surface: Repair hairline cracks with waterproofing mix. Repair larger cracks by cleaning out and patching with mortar.\n- Mist the area: Finely spray the masonry before applying waterproofer.\n- Apply the sealant: Paint masonry surface with a thick coat of sealant. Be sure to push the sealant into cracks and crevices of surface. A paint roller or brush made specifically for masonry is best.\n- Let it dry: Allow to dry overnight or for a minimum of 12 hours between coats.\n- Apply a second coat: Apply another coat of sealant and allow it to dry.\n- Paint: Now you can paint the surface any color you want. Remember, if you need to re-apply sealant in a few years, you will have to remove that paint layer."}

Instead, move your arm carefully back and forth to spray. Do not over flex your wrist. Keep the gun positioned to prevent spray arches that can make an uneven coating of paint.\n- Regularly wipe the tip of the paint sprayer with a rag to prevent paint from drying and disrupting the spray pattern.\n- Paint any eaves and corners first. Work from the top down.\n- Clean the entire spray painter thoroughly, following the manufacturer’s instructions once your project is finished.\n- Do not store paint in the paint sprayer for any extended period.\n- Keep safety in mind when operating a paint sprayer. Never aim the sprayer at a person or animal.\n- Paint that lands on the skin from a high-pressure sprayer can be hazardous. If that happens, seek immediate medical attention."}

A heavy-duty cleaner may help to remove dirt and grease from the walls and trim. Be sure to keep rags, buckets, water and paint sticks nearby for mixing. These will also come in handy for cleanup and mixing afterward.\n- Wear old clothes and a hat while painting.\n- Make sure you have rubber gloves and eye protection on hand.\n- Whenever you start any interior house painting project, always work in a properly ventilated space. You must open all windows and doors. You should also use fans and proper safety gear, like a [respirator mask](/b/Safety-Equipment-Respirator-Masks/N-5yc1vZc25k) and ventilator.

It's used to help insulate, absorb sound and reduce wear on your floor. It can also serve as a vapor barrier.\n- Floor levelers are cement-based products that come premixed or as dry substances to mix with water. Choose a product recommended for your application and mix it, if needed, following the manufacturer’s directions.\n- Floor patches are products that help repair holes, cracks, small dips and other imperfections. Follow the directions on your product for how to apply it.\n- If the manufacturer recommends it, go over the subfloor with a damp [sponge](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Sponges-Scouring-Pads/N-5yc1vZcb3k) before you apply a floor leveler. This will help keep it from drying too fast, so you’ll have time to spread it around.\n- Pour the liquid-like floor leveler onto the subfloor and smooth it out with a [trowel](/b/Building-Materials-Concrete-Cement-Masonry-Concrete-Tools-Concrete-Trowels/N-5yc1vZaq1d). Gravity will help it settle into the low areas. Remove any excess floor leveler and feather it around the edges so it blends with the rest of the floor. Let the floor leveler dry overnight or as indicated by the manufacturer.\n- After the floor leveler dries, sand down any high spots to make them flush with the rest of the floor.\n- Use a wet-vac to vacuum up dust and debris. Make a final check with a carpenter's level or straight pipe to be sure all the low spots are gone."}

If the opening is narrow, put them on a paper plate and fold them into a funnel shape. Put the tip of the funnel into the neck of the container and gently shake the pebbles out. If you don’t have a paper plate, use a few sheets of newspaper. The pebbles will let excess water drain away from the plants. If plant roots sit in water, they won’t get enough oxygen and will die.\n- Put a light layer of activated charcoal chips over the pebbles. Stores that carry pet and fish supplies will likely have this charcoal. It will help absorb odors that can build up over time, especially in closed terrariums.\n- Add a layer of moss over the charcoal to help keep the charcoal from floating when you water the plants. If you can’t reach into the container, fold the moss or tear it into small pieces and drop it in. If you need to move the moss around, use a wooden skewer or a chopstick."}

Once filler is dry, sand the area until the surface is level and smooth. Then apply stain or other finish as desired.\n- Tip: As the name suggests, stain can leave permanent discolorations on whatever it touches.

When it drips back down onto the plants, they get another watering, which makes a terrarium very low-maintenance.\n- An open terrarium is just what it sounds like. It’s a container with an opening that lets air circulate. In an open terrarium, you’ll need to add more water from time to time, as it will eventually evaporate, and the soil and plants will begin to dry out.\n- A closed terrarium is a glass container with a lid. It should be opened about once a month to let fresh air in. While it’s open, some of the moisture inside also evaporates, so you’ll need to add a little more water. You just won’t need to water as often as with an open terrarium."}

The Home Depot also sells waterproofing options like [Red Gard](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-RedGard-3-1-2-Gal-Waterproofing-and-Crack-Prevention-Membrane-LQWAF3/100678063) and [PVC shower liners](https://www.homedepot.com/p/5-ft-x-6-ft-PVC-Shower-Pan-Liner-Kit-41620/100344211), if this Kerdi system doesn’t give you all the happy feels like it did us.

Use a drop cloth to cover the floor. Put painter’s tape on any surfaces and fixtures that you don’t want to get paint on.\n- Whether your goal is to update mosaic tiles for a hallway or painting bathroom tiles with a splash of color, one of the most important steps in learning how to paint tiles is using a primer. [Primers](/b/Paint-Primers/N-5yc1vZbt0t) hide unwanted colors and designs. When you’re painting tile, using bonding primer will help new paint adhere better to the tiles. It can also help keep the paint from chipping and peeling in the future.\n- Working on clean, dry tile, roll the primer evenly over the tiles. Use two coats if necessary, letting primer dry between coats before moving to the next step. If you are hand painting tiles, use a small [paint brush](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Brushes/N-5yc1vZarac) to paint details onto the tiles.\n- As you’re applying primer and painting tile, work safely. Make sure the area is well-ventilated. Wear a mask, gloves and protective eyewear."}

When deciding what color to paint them, take into consideration all the other aspects in the room such as tile, countertop colors, light fixtures, and cabinet pulls. Don’t work against it all, work with it.\n- I chose Behr MARQUEE [White paint](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-MARQUEE-1-gal-Ultra-Pure-White-Matte-Interior-Paint-and-Primer-in-One-145001/204747469) for the wall cabinets . For the island, I decided to change it up and go with a real dark navy blue color, called [Winter Way](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-MARQUEE-1-gal-PPU25-23-Winter-Way-Satin-Enamel-Interior-Paint-and-Primer-in-One-745301/300007622). I loved the way it looked with my grey island countertop and it surprisingly went really nice with the black countertops on the wall cabinets.\n- I removed all the cabinet doors, cleaned, [sanded](/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Sanders/N-5yc1vZc28s) and de-glossed them, and then painted them all in my garage with a [foam brush roller](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Rollers/N-5yc1vZaqpy). I was going to spray them, but MARQUEE brand recommends not using an air powered sprayer, which is what I have.\n- The colors went great with my current cabinet pulls. I debated whether I should get new ones, but sometimes, by picking the correct colors, it can completely change the look of them. That’s exactly what happened here. I thought they looked too outdated and rustic for the space, but against the white and blue, the copper undertone stood out. This is where the next choice came into play."}

Drying refers to evaporation of the water or solvents in the paint. It will feel dry to the touch. Curing, on the other hand, is when the paint has completed its chemical bonding with the surface. At this point, it will have reached maximum hardness.\n- While paint is curing, the surface shouldn’t be used. If it’s a floor, for example, it shouldn’t be walked on yet.\n- Read the paint can’s instructions for drying time between coats. Curing takes much longer and depends on the type of paint. Both drying and curing depend on the paint, the thickness of the layer(s), the ambient temperature and humidity, ventilation/air circulation and other exterior factors. Curing can take anywhere from four to 30 days."}

We started with the shower floor. Because I didn’t want to have to cut tiles to match the slope of the shower pan, I used these adorable little [penny tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Finesse-Glossy-White-12-in-x-13-in-x-6-35-mm-Porcelain-Penny-Round-Mosaic-Wall-Tile-1-06-sq-ft-piece-FE0811PNYRDHD1P/300049525). Installing them was really easy. I started by cutting one edge of the tiles with my [wet saw](/b/Flooring-Flooring-Supplies-Flooring-Tools-Tile-Tools-Tile-Saws/N-5yc1vZcdt8), so the edge was square and even.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-7.jpg)\n- Then I started laying in the back corner, working my way across the back wall and then forward. You will spread a layer of [thinset](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-VersaBond-White-50-lbs-Fortified-Thinset-Mortar-MTSW50/100091767) with the notched side of your [trowel](https://www.homedepot.com/p/HDX-9-in-x-3-8-in-x-1-4-in-Square-Notch-Economy-Flooring-Trowel-10114X/203713870), then lay your tile. Take your time on these penny tiles. Because you don’t use spacers, you’ll need to be very deliberate and careful to make sure everything stays straight and level. You’ll also need to cut the tile to fit your drain. We used an [angle grinder](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-18-Volt-ONE-Cordless-4-1-2-in-Angle-Grinder-Tool-Only-P421/100519983) to cut the tiles so they fit perfectly around the drain.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-8.jpg)"}

If you plan to hang a ceiling fan inside a damp area, such as the bathroom or outdoors, you will need to find one that meets UL's wet/damp rating. A damp rating means the fan can be used in areas with excessive moisture, but covered, such as on a covered patio or in a bathroom. A wet rating means the fan can withstand direct rain, snow or excessive moisture as in an open gazebo.\n- Tip: While an outdoor fan can be used indoors, an indoor ceiling fan should only be hung inside your home."}

It won't drip or run, allowing for more precise application and reducing the likelihood of it spilling onto the floor or furniture.\n- Gels are often effective in removing wallpaper that has been applied to unprimed drywall or used clay-based adhesives. A good gel should liquefy the adhesive without softening or soaking the face of the drywall.\n- Use a spray bottle, brush or roller to apply and let sit for 20 to 30 minutes so it can soak in.\n- After the gel has soaked the wallpaper, use a scraper to peel up the wallpaper in strips."}

This small area can house your pet’s food and water stations. It could also be used for their sleeping and relaxation needs by including their bed, crate or vertical spaces, depending on the type of pet you have. In this case, you may want to have lighting that can be muted to be less stimulating. If the space is big enough, you can also store food, toys, carriers, leashes, collars and other pet-related items. For pets that need to be kept separated from the rest of the home when you leave for a few hours, a pet room may be a solution."}

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 2: Priming Considerations\n- Wall surfaces like drywall, masonry and wood are porous. If you don't use primer, they can absorb paint unevenly. You might end up adding more coats of paint than you planned to.\n- On walls that are already painted with a glossy finish, or when using latex paint on top of an oil-based finish, a new coat of paint applied directly on top might have trouble adhering without a coat of primer for it to hold onto.\n- When painting over a dark-colored wall, a coat or two of primer provides a clean and neutral canvas for a lighter paint color to refresh your room.\n- Primer is typically less expensive than paint. Using primer instead of several coats of new paint may lower the cost of your paint job.\n- Primer works well to cover previous paint colors and flaws or spots on the wall. But if your walls are in great shape and the new coat of paint is a similar color to the old one, you may not need primer."}

If you’re removing the flooring in a kitchen or bathroom, turn off water supplies. You should also remove all appliances, like refrigerators, ovens, pedestal sinks, vanities and toilets.\n- Once the room is empty, carefully remove the baseboards from the wall with a trim puller. You may prefer to use a prybar and rubber mallet. Little by little, work the trim free from the wall. If you plan to reuse the trim, mark the back with its location in the room.

Be aware that they'll need more care than most other small houseplants. Give them an open terrarium, because water evaporates slowly from closed containers. They can die if they stay too wet. They also need good air circulation.\n- Follow the directions above for making a terrarium but use African violet potting mix instead of regular potting soil. Position your plant so that it's not touching the glass. Keep the terrarium in bright, indirect light. Water lightly when the soil begins to dry out. Remove faded flowers and any leaves that show signs of fungus, mildew or other problems. In a humid terrarium, diseases and pests can spread fast.\n- For another unique look, use air plants in an open container. They need air and small amounts of water that they absorb through their leaves. They don’t need soil, so just put them inside the terrarium and mist them a few times each week. In hot weather, take them out once a week and soak them in a bowl of water for an hour or two. In cold weather, mist them a few times each week. Soak them about every two to three weeks. Use rainwater, purified water or tap water that can stand for 24 hours so the chlorine can evaporate.\n- Keep your air plants in bright, indirect light and they may bloom for you."}

Roller-style wallpaper scorers are extremely effective at puncturing the wallpaper with dozens of tiny holes. Use light pressure when running the scorer over the wall to avoid scratching the wall. Blade-based wallpaper scorers are cheaper but slice lines into the wallpaper and are less effective.\n- Apply the liquid remover with a spray bottle for quick coverage over a larger area, but use a sponge or other tool in corners or places where precision is required.\n- Allow the solution to soak the wall as specified by the manufacturer’s instructions.\n- Once the liquid remover has softened the adhesive, peel off the paper or use a [paint scraper](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Tools-Paint-Scrapers/Paint-Scrapers/N-5yc1vZci29Z1z0t5dr) or putty knife to remove it."}

Always measure doorways and stairways before placing your furniture order.\n- Know the height, width and depth for the furniture that you want in your space. This can be found in the product details in the online description.\n- Measure doorways, pathways and stairways to your home. If there are elevators and hallways, get those measurements, too, including the elevator door opening. These measurements must be greater than the furniture dimensions in order for the furniture to be moved into your space.\n- When measuring, you’ll want to use the interior measurement of the doorways, passageways and hallways. Note the placement of architectural details like doorknobs, light fixtures and trim like chair rail on your sketch.\n- Tip: Measure twice for accuracy. Ask a friend to help with running the tape measure and making sketches.\n- Properly measuring your room for furniture will help you design a comfortable living space and will save aggravation with furniture delivery.\n- With proper planning and precise measurements, you can get the right size furniture for your space. Start by measuring the entryway for delivery.

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 6: How to Prime Walls for Painting\n- Begin by using a high-quality [paint brush](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Brushes/N-5yc1vZarac) to brush paint 2-3 inches along the edge of the wall, windows and corners of a room. This process is known as \"cutting in.\"\n- For best results, work in one small area at a time.\n- You may want to follow the process of \"edging painting.\" This involves cutting in the wall's edges before painting rolling or painting the entire wall. Doing so prevents the borders from drying before you finish painting the wall. It also keeps the sheen uniform. If edging, use an angled brush to apply a thick coat.\n- Choose the right roller cover for your wall surface and place it onto your [paint roller](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Rollers/N-5yc1vZaqpy). For smooth ceilings, use a low nap roller. For a textured ceiling, use a thicker roller, with a 1/2-inch or 3/4-inch nap.\n- Pour primer into a paint tray.\n- Dip the roller into the paint, making sure it’s completely covered.\n- Roll the paint roller over the ridged area of the [paint tray](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Trays-and-Liners/N-5yc1vZaqcd) a few times to remove excess paint.\n- With a fully loaded paint roller, work top to bottom. Roll it back and forth across the wall in a series of V- or W-shaped strokes.\n- Roll in one section at a time, moving from top to bottom and from one side of the wall to the other. The goal is to achieve even coverage, with no drips. Press lightly on the roller to prevent drips and lines.\n- Reload the roller and paint the next section. Cover only as much as you can finish while the primer is still wet. Overlap areas of wet primer only."}

Painting tile is much easier than installing tile.\n- You won’t have to take out the old tile or figure out how to dispose of it.\n- Getting ready to paint tile includes making minor repairs to your existing tile, which can improve its appearance.\n- Paint doesn’t last as long as the finish on tile. The paint you apply may come off over the years. Paint might not be the best option for high traffic tile, such as floors.\n- Similarly, painting tiles in a shower, painting tiles in the bathroom, or painting any other tiles that get wet often may be inefficient.\n- When you paint tile, the grout will be painted over, too. You’ll no longer see the contrast between the grout and tile.\n- You need to do a thorough job of cleaning and repairing the tile before you get started.\n- While the paint dries, you may not be able to use the room the tile is in."}
{"prompt": "You are a procedural assistant trained to guide users through technical SOPs step-by-step with clarity and context.\n\n### User:\nWhat is Step 2 for Installing Cement Board?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 2: What is Backer Board?\n- [Cement board](/b/Building-Materials-Drywall-Cement-Boards/N-5yc1vZcb0f), often referred to as backer board, is a thin layer of concrete with fiberglass mesh on both sides. It’s available in sheets of many sizes. Most projects need 3-foot by 5-foot sheets.\n- Whenever you’re laying tile on a wood subfloor, you need to first install cement backer board. Backer board prevents leaks and water damage that could harm your flooring and the structure of your home. Unlike wood or drywall sub-surfaces, cement backer board will not rot, warp or grow mold and mildew when exposed to water. That’s the main reason they’re a go-to choice for permanent installations like this.\n- Another reason you’ll need to work with cement backer board is that it’s never safe to install new tiles over existing tiles. You also can’t safely install tile flooring over plywood subfloor or onto an unprotected wood floor. If you did, there'd be a serious risk of rot, water damage, warping and mold. Plus, your tile and grout would likely crack."}

Put painter’s tape on any surfaces and fixtures that you don’t want to get paint on.\n- Whether your goal is to update mosaic tiles for a hallway or painting bathroom tiles with a splash of color, one of the most important steps in learning how to paint tiles is using a primer. [Primers](/b/Paint-Primers/N-5yc1vZbt0t) hide unwanted colors and designs. When you’re painting tile, using bonding primer will help new paint adhere better to the tiles. It can also help keep the paint from chipping and peeling in the future.\n- Working on clean, dry tile, roll the primer evenly over the tiles. Use two coats if necessary, letting primer dry between coats before moving to the next step. If you are hand painting tiles, use a small [paint brush](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Brushes/N-5yc1vZarac) to paint details onto the tiles.\n- As you’re applying primer and painting tile, work safely.

Laminate flooring has a shorter lifespan than either engineered or solid hardwood, lasting between 15 to 25 years or sometimes longer with proper care. Some people choose laminate over wood flooring because of its low cost per square foot and superior resistance to daily wear and tear."}

{"prompt": "You are a procedural assistant trained to guide users through technical SOPs step-by-step with clarity and context.\n\n### User:\nWhat is Step 11 for Tiling a Basement Shower?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 11: Step 9: Cut Openings for Faucet and Shower Head\n- Eventually you will need to cut out the hole for your faucet and shower handle. We used an [angle grinder](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-18-Volt-ONE-Cordless-4-1-2-in-Angle-Grinder-Tool-Only-P421/100519983) to cut the tile to the shape we wanted BEFORE we put the tile on the wall. The Home Depot also sells [diamond hole saws](https://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-1-3-8-in-Pro-Wet-Dry-Diamond-Hole-Saw-10087Q/205553933), but we weren’t worried about making it pretty, since our [faucet handle](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Pfister-Venturi-Single-Handle-1-Spray-Tub-and-Shower-Faucet-in-Spot-Defense-Brushed-Nickel-Valve-Included-8P8-WS2VNSGS/300721652) has a big plate to cover any mistakes we made.

Since our basement ceilings aren’t very high, we knew we wanted our shower to go to the ceiling. We had to cut the last tile to fit up to the ceiling. If you aren’t tiling up to the ceiling, I suggest finishing off your edge with [Schluter tile edging](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Schluter-Jolly-Bright-Black-Anodized-Aluminum-1-2-in-x-8-ft-2-1-2-in-Metal-Tile-Edging-Trim-A125AGSG/202602072).\n- After I paint the ceiling, I will apply a layer of caulk where my ceiling meets my tile. That way, we know the seam is watertight and we don’t have to worry about water or vapor getting behind the tile at the top. You can get [caulk that matches your grout](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-Polyblend-09-Natural-Gray-10-5-oz-Sanded-Ceramic-Tile-Caulk-PC0910S/100678060), so that will help it look really nice at the top. But like I said, that will wait until after I paint the ceiling, which I didn’t do yet, because I knew I would probably get grout and thinset on it."}

Similarly, you can find engineered hardwood floors that are [dent resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Dent-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z191cs).\n- UV resistant: The finish blocks UV rays from sunlight so the wood color won’t fade.\n- [Waterproof](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Waterproof/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1bmdp): Protect against damage from spills with waterproof or [water resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Water-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1bmb3) flooring.\n- [Stainable](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Stainable/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z181te): Stainable floors allow you to refresh or change the color in the future.\n- [Supports refinishing](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Supports-Refinishing/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1984l): If you want the flooring to last a long time, find engineered hardwood that can be refinished if it gets damaged or worn-looking.\n- Find out if the engineered wood flooring requires an underlayment for installation. [Underlayment](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Flooring-Supplies-Surface-Prep-Underlayment/N-5yc1vZcdtw) is a thin material placed between the flooring and the subfloor. It helps absorb noise, adds insulation and protects both the flooring and subfloor from water damage. It also helps correct uneven subfloors. Most wood flooring requires an underlayment, but some engineered wood floors have an attached underlayment.\n- To choose the color of your engineered hardwood flooring, decide whether you want light, medium or dark toned wood.\n- [Light engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Light/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7p): Light tones brighten rooms and have an airy and open aesthetic. They’re great for minimalist and coastal styles but may show dirt more easily.\n- [Medium engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Medium/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7u): These traditional wood tones match most home decor styles. Medium toned wood floors are the most popular choice with the widest selection of flooring. They can have warm or cool undertones.\n- [Dark engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Dark/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7j): These luxurious wood tones can make rooms feel cozy and welcoming. Dark floors are great for many styles of homes from modern to traditional. Dark wood can include cool, nearly black tones or warm red tones.\n- Alternatively, narrow down your choice by searching for specific color families: brown, red, gray, tan, white, black are some examples.\n- Textured engineered wood flooring already has dents, scuffs and simulated damage of varying degrees on the plank surface. There’s less need to worry about actual damage from daily wear and tear. Plus, textured flooring will need less maintenance than non-textured flooring. Note that if you resurface textured floors, you’ll lose some of its initial texture.\n- [Smooth](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Smooth/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n40): Smooth floors have a sleek and shiny finish that shows a wood pattern without the surface texture. This is a popular choice in many modern homes. Smooth flooring may dent and scuff more easily than textured flooring.\n- [Distressed](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Distressed/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n4s): This texture mimics the appearance of older wood and adds an air of history and lived-in comfort. Distressed floors better hides scuffs and dents. Since it looks like reclaimed wood, this texture is a great option for rustic, industrial or traditional homes.\n- [Wire brushed](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Wire-Brushed/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17ngu): Wire brushed engineered wood adds subtle texture for an elegant, solid hardwood appearance. It blends in perfectly with most styles of homes.\n- [Hand scraped](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Hand-Scraped/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n41): Hand scraped engineered wood has a stronger texture than wire brushed. Hand scraping is usually one aspect of distressed engineered wood floors, since it adds an antiqued appearance. The texture’s irregularity makes the wood look more convincing as solid hardwood. This is a great texture choice for historical, traditional or rustic homes."}

Latex primer is considered an all-purpose primer and is easy to clean up with water. [Oil-based primer](/b/Paint-Primers/Oil-Based/N-5yc1vZbt0tZ1z1p6ug) is also versatile. It's the preferred choice for blocking stains, wood tannin and for covering porous wood surfaces.\n- Be sure to have enough paint primer before starting your project. Trying to figure out how much primer you need? A gallon of primer will cover between 250 to 400-square feet of surface. Two coats of primer may be required over heavy stains or tannin-rich wood.\n- Most primers can be tinted to help ensure good coverage for the finish coat.

Drying refers to evaporation of the water or solvents in the paint. It will feel dry to the touch. Curing, on the other hand, is when the paint has completed its chemical bonding with the surface. At this point, it will have reached maximum hardness.\n- While paint is curing, the surface shouldn’t be used. If it’s a floor, for example, it shouldn’t be walked on yet.\n- Read the paint can’s instructions for drying time between coats. Curing takes much longer and depends on the type of paint. Both drying and curing depend on the paint, the thickness of the layer(s), the ambient temperature and humidity, ventilation/air circulation and other exterior factors. Curing can take anywhere from four to 30 days."}

Wedge the spade under the tiles and “shovel” to break them up.\n- Older tile can be firmly attached to the subfloor and very difficult to remove. Consider renting a jackhammer with a chisel when removing a tile floor. Be especially careful to wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from the flying tile and mortar chips."}

Plus, engineered wood flooring typically is available in a vast variety of colors, textures and sizes.\n- Durable: Engineered wood flooring has a stable construction that withstands natural temperature and moisture changes. Most types can be refinished at least once if they get too damaged.\n- Light-resistant: Most types of engineered wood floors are UV-resistant, so they won’t fade from the sun.\n- Mold-resistant: While not all types of engineered wood floors are fully waterproof, engineered wood is more waterproof than other flooring materials. Not only does it resist warping and water damage, it also resists mold growth.\n- Easy to maintain: Engineered wood floors are easy to clean and are usually pre-finished with a protective coating that doesn’t require additional coats of finish or shine.\n- Multiple installation options: Unlike solid hardwood, engineered wood floors can be installed below-grade, over concrete subfloors and heated floors. They can also be installed with multiple different methods, which are covered in the next section.\n- Lower cost: Engineered wood flooring is slightly more budget friendly per square foot than solid hardwood, while still looking like solid hardwood."}

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 2: Priming Considerations\n- Wall surfaces like drywall, masonry and wood are porous. If you don't use primer, they can absorb paint unevenly. You might end up adding more coats of paint than you planned to.\n- On walls that are already painted with a glossy finish, or when using latex paint on top of an oil-based finish, a new coat of paint applied directly on top might have trouble adhering without a coat of primer for it to hold onto.\n- When painting over a dark-colored wall, a coat or two of primer provides a clean and neutral canvas for a lighter paint color to refresh your room.\n- Primer is typically less expensive than paint. Using primer instead of several coats of new paint may lower the cost of your paint job.\n- Primer works well to cover previous paint colors and flaws or spots on the wall. But if your walls are in great shape and the new coat of paint is a similar color to the old one, you may not need primer."}

If you’ll be looking at only one side of the terrarium, put taller plants toward the back. Remember to leave room for them to grow and don’t crowd too many into the container.\n- Use a spoon or your fingers to make holes for the plants in the potting soil. Add a cork to the end of your skewer or chopstick to make a tamping tool and use it to gently firm the soil around the plants.\n- If you get any soil on the glass, use a small, dry paint brush to remove it.\n- Add another layer of moss around the plants for a finished look or use more pebbles or sea glass. Water lightly with a small watering can or spray bottle. Avoid watering so much that water collects in the bottom.\n- Trying adding small tools, shells or other decorations to your terrarium, if desired. Small children’s toys, like plastic dinosaurs, to make a fun “prehistoric jungle” terrarium.\n- Keep your terrarium out of direct sunlight, so the sun coming through the glass won’t burn the plants.

What's next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 7: Engineered Wood Flooring Materials\n- [Oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11yin): A readily available wood, oak is a commonly used material in engineered wood flooring. Oak is a light-colored wood that has varying undertones. [Red oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Red-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11uq9) has pink undertones, [white oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/White-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z117p3) has yellow and gold undertones and [French oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/French-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z0m8y8) has gray undertones. White and French oak are both slightly tougher than red oak, which is more prone to scratches.\n- [Hickory](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Hickory/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11e6m): An extremely hard and durable wood, hickory is another very popular choice for flooring. It’s more durable than oak, making it a good choice for rooms with heavy traffic. Hickory is a light- to medium-toned wood with contrasting stripes in its natural pattern.\n- [Maple](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Maple/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11xzp): Maple has an even texture and pattern, which makes it a good choice for sleek, stained floors. It’s naturally light-toned but can be stained a wide variety of colors. Note that if you don’t want to stain and finish a floor yourself, most engineered wood floors come pre-stained and finished from a manufacturer. Maple is tougher than oak, but not quite as tough as hickory.\n- [Birch](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Birch/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11dkr): Like oak, birch wood also comes in multiple varieties—yellow birch and red birch. Both varieties are equally as strong and are both more durable than oak. Birch is a good choice for rooms with medium to heavy foot traffic.\n- [Bamboo](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Bamboo-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbrfe): While not technically wood, bamboo makes an excellent flooring material that has the look and texture of real wood. Its strength and durability can vary between manufacturers, but it’s typically more durable than the hardwoods in this list. Bamboo flooring can be refinished, stained and installed just like any other engineered wood flooring. Plus, bamboo is an eco-friendly renewable resource."}

Be aware that they'll need more care than most other small houseplants. Give them an open terrarium, because water evaporates slowly from closed containers. They can die if they stay too wet. They also need good air circulation.\n- Follow the directions above for making a terrarium but use African violet potting mix instead of regular potting soil. Position your plant so that it's not touching the glass. Keep the terrarium in bright, indirect light. Water lightly when the soil begins to dry out. Remove faded flowers and any leaves that show signs of fungus, mildew or other problems. In a humid terrarium, diseases and pests can spread fast.\n- For another unique look, use air plants in an open container. They need air and small amounts of water that they absorb through their leaves. They don’t need soil, so just put them inside the terrarium and mist them a few times each week. In hot weather, take them out once a week and soak them in a bowl of water for an hour or two. In cold weather, mist them a few times each week. Soak them about every two to three weeks. Use rainwater, purified water or tap water that can stand for 24 hours so the chlorine can evaporate.\n- Keep your air plants in bright, indirect light and they may bloom for you."}

Place painter’s tape in short, overlapping strips for more control and best coverage.\n- If you have a textured ceiling and are painting only the walls, run a screwdriver along the ceiling's edge. This creates a small, unnoticeable, texture-free surface for the painter's tape to adhere to. It is then easier to create a straight paint edge.\n- If you're painting an accent wall, mask off the inside edge of the wall from the rest of the room."}

Wait 24 to 48 hours before tiling. The drying time is important for a strong hold.\n- Fully bonded mortar means your cement board won't flex. This protects your tile and grout from cracking. It's key to making your tile floor last as long as possible. It also means that if your grout did crack and water seeped through, your subfloor would be protected by the cement board."}

Drying refers to evaporation of the water or solvents in the paint. It will feel dry to the touch. Curing, on the other hand, is when the paint has completed its chemical bonding with the surface. At this point, it will have reached maximum hardness.\n- While paint is curing, the surface shouldn’t be used. If it’s a floor, for example, it shouldn’t be walked on yet.\n- Read the paint can’s instructions for drying time between coats. Curing takes much longer and depends on the type of paint. Both drying and curing depend on the paint, the thickness of the layer(s), the ambient temperature and humidity, ventilation/air circulation and other exterior factors. Curing can take anywhere from four to 30 days."}

A clean surface ensures a better seal. Use a general cleaner to remove dirt, mold or mildew. Let the wood surfaces dry completely before proceeding to the next step. If it’s a new wood surface, you can skip the cleaning process.\n- Sand down wood: After the surface is dry, give it a good sanding with rough sandpaper or with a [sander](/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Sanders/N-5yc1vZc28s) to tackle any imperfections. Finish with finer sandpaper to make it smooth and even. Wipe the surface thoroughly to remove any sanding residue.\n- Choose the right stain or sealant: Most sealants and stains are sold for the application you need it for. Pick the one that makes sense for your surface.\n- Apply the first coat: Apply the sealant or stain evenly with your brush or sprayer. Allow the surface to dry for four to ten hours, depending on the product's instructions.\n- Sand the surface: To form an effective waterproof barrier, you will have to apply multiple coats of stain or sealant. Sanding between coats will allow the next layer to adhere better. Use very fine sandpaper or “0000” steel wool to sand the surface. Wipe the surface down again with a dry cloth to prepare it for the second coat.\n- Apply the next coat: Add another layer of stain or sealant and let it dry for four to ten hours. Sand and apply waterproofing again, if necessary.\n- Let it cure: The wood needs to cure for around three days before using it or placing any furniture on top of it."}

Wedge the spade under the tiles and “shovel” to break them up.\n- Older tile can be firmly attached to the subfloor and very difficult to remove. Consider renting a jackhammer with a chisel when removing a tile floor. Be especially careful to wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from the flying tile and mortar chips."}

Measure the size of the room to determine how much vinyl plank flooring to purchase. Try to ensure your measurements are as accurate as possible, then buy about 10 to 20 percent more flooring than you believe you will need. This will ensure you have enough planks to floor the entire room as well as extras for cutting or future replacements.\n- Your subfloor should be clean, rigid, level and free of cracks. Remove any carpeting or old vinyl flooring and temporarily remove the baseboard. If you are installing vinyl planks in a bathroom, you may need to temporarily remove the toilet, or you can install around it.\n- If the subfloor is not level, you can fix low spots with a [self-leveling](/b/Flooring-Flooring-Supplies-Surface-Prep-Floor-Patch/Self-Leveling/N-5yc1vZcdu9Z1z0meb1) product and sand or grind down high spots.\n- Tip: Do not try to sand down old vinyl flooring, as it may contain asbestos.

If you’ll be looking at only one side of the terrarium, put taller plants toward the back. Remember to leave room for them to grow and don’t crowd too many into the container.\n- Use a spoon or your fingers to make holes for the plants in the potting soil. Add a cork to the end of your skewer or chopstick to make a tamping tool and use it to gently firm the soil around the plants.\n- If you get any soil on the glass, use a small, dry paint brush to remove it.\n- Add another layer of moss around the plants for a finished look or use more pebbles or sea glass. Water lightly with a small watering can or spray bottle. Avoid watering so much that water collects in the bottom.\n- Trying adding small tools, shells or other decorations to your terrarium, if desired. Small children’s toys, like plastic dinosaurs, to make a fun “prehistoric jungle” terrarium.\n- Keep your terrarium out of direct sunlight, so the sun coming through the glass won’t burn the plants. Prune them when needed and rotate the terrarium occasionally, so they don’t lean in just one direction."}

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 6: More Terrarium Ideas\n- Grow miniature African violets in a terrarium to enjoy their colorful blooms. Be aware that they'll need more care than most other small houseplants. Give them an open terrarium, because water evaporates slowly from closed containers. They can die if they stay too wet. They also need good air circulation.\n- Follow the directions above for making a terrarium but use African violet potting mix instead of regular potting soil. Position your plant so that it's not touching the glass. Keep the terrarium in bright, indirect light. Water lightly when the soil begins to dry out. Remove faded flowers and any leaves that show signs of fungus, mildew or other problems. In a humid terrarium, diseases and pests can spread fast.\n- For another unique look, use air plants in an open container. They need air and small amounts of water that they absorb through their leaves. They don’t need soil, so just put them inside the terrarium and mist them a few times each week. In hot weather, take them out once a week and soak them in a bowl of water for an hour or two. In cold weather, mist them a few times each week. Soak them about every two to three weeks. Use rainwater, purified water or tap water that can stand for 24 hours so the chlorine can evaporate.\n- Keep your air plants in bright, indirect light and they may bloom for you."}

Very slowly, but surely, I’ve updated every single room except for one: our master bathroom. It is the only room in our house I left untouched since the moment we moved in almost 20 years ago!\n- However, waiting so long to renovate this room gave me the opportunity to define the most important features I wanted to include in the new and improved bathroom.

Laminate planks snap together and “float” above a subfloor, which means tiny subfloor imperfections are okay, although, a level subfloor will help prevent damage.\n- To level a subfloor for installing laminate, follow the directions above to remove high and low spots. After vacuuming or sweeping the subfloor to clean it, add a [plywood](/b/Lumber-Composites-Plywood/N-5yc1vZbqm7) layer if the subfloor is in very bad shape, but do not overlap the sheets.

If you're trying to figure out how to cut vinyl flooring planks, experts recommend scoring the plank with a utility knife and snapping it. Vinyl cutters are a good solution too. For more complicated cuts, consider a jigsaw or miter saw. Other tools you’ll need include measuring tape, a chalk or crayon, a straightedge and a vacuum. Some manufacturers recommend a tapping block and rubber mallet.\n- If you are installing glue-down vinyl planks, make sure you have vinyl floor adhesive\n- and a notched trowel.

Do this until the section is covered.\n- Before reloading your roller and moving to the next section, roll over the area you’ve just painted. Use a smooth, continuous stroke, going from top to bottom. These smoothing strokes even the coat, catch any drips and help to cover up lines and tracks.\n- Overlap areas already painted. Lightly lift the roller off the wall to avoid leaving end marks. This also lets you seamlessly blend different areas.\n- Frequently remix paint, using a mixing stick or a paint mixing tool. Do this any time you leave your paint sitting for an extended period of time.\n- Wait 2-4 hours for the first coat to dry before applying a second coat.\n- Follow the same process and techniques used when priming walls, blending sections as you work.\n- To prevent paint from drying on the roller, store your paint roller in a plastic bag between coats. This will keep the paint and brush moist between uses.\n- Keep your paint color uniform. Once you’ve used half a gallon of paint, refill that can with paint from a different can and mix together. If you’re doing a large job, mix several gallons into one 5-gallon bucket."}

A wet rating means the fan can withstand direct rain, snow or excessive moisture as in an open gazebo.\n- Tip: While an outdoor fan can be used indoors, an indoor ceiling fan should only be hung inside your home."}

It's best to work in small sections and make more solution as needed.\n- Allow the cleaner to sit for up to 15 minutes to give the ingredients time to work, then scrub and rinse until all the cleaner is removed. Use firm pressure and make several passes over each grout line.\n- Assemble and load the steam cleaner according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Use only water. Do not add additional chemicals or cleaning solutions to the cleaner’s water tank.\n- Once the machine has heated up, turn on the steam function and apply the cleaning brush to the dirty areas of grout.\n- Use a rag or mop to thoroughly dry up the residual water after steam cleaning.\n- Steam cleaning can remove grout sealant along with dirt and mildew.

This ability gives it a much longer lifespan than engineered wood floors. With the right installation and care, solid hardwood can last a literal lifetime, anywhere from 30 to 100 years. However, solid hardwood is prone to warping from temperature and moisture changes, so it should only be installed above-grade. Wider solid hardwood planks may also need to be glued and nailed down to a wood subfloor to prevent movement.\n- Engineered wood flooring can also be refinished if it has a thick hardwood veneer. Thinner veneers typically can’t be refinished, so the flooring only has a lifespan of up to 30 years. Thick veneers can help engineered wood flooring last up to 80 years. Engineered wood planks are also sturdier and less likely to warp over time, so they can be installed below-grade and over wood or concrete subfloors.\n- When it comes to cost, solid hardwood is typically more expensive per square foot than engineered hardwood. Higher quality engineered hardwood can get as expensive as a mid- to upper-range solid hardwood, but the labor for installing either type of flooring is usually the same and makes up the bulk of the cost.\n- Tip: Both engineered and solid hardwood floors can make a home more appealing to future buyers and add resale value."}

Apply it to the dirty areas of the grout following the manufacturer's instructions.\n- If you prefer cleaning grout with a DIY mixture, make a paste of 3/4-cup baking soda, 1/4-cup hydrogen peroxide and 1 tablespoon of mild dish soap. Apply the paste to the grout with a [grout brush](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Cleaning-Brushes-Scrub-Brushes/Tile-and-Grout-Brush/N-5yc1vZcb49Z1z0pidd) and scrub the grout. Grout brushes have compact heads and dense, firm bristles to help loosen the grime that builds up in the grooves.\n- Do not use acidic cleaners as they may dissolve or pit the grout. Do not use waxy or oil-based cleaners as these can leave a film that will attract dirt and make future cleaning more difficult.\n- Chlorine bleach may be used on white grout but will leach color out of tinted grout. [Oxygen bleach](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Products-Bleach/N-5yc1vZcb5b) is a better choice for preserving colored grout between tiles."}

Be aware that they'll need more care than most other small houseplants. Give them an open terrarium, because water evaporates slowly from closed containers. They can die if they stay too wet. They also need good air circulation.\n- Follow the directions above for making a terrarium but use African violet potting mix instead of regular potting soil. Position your plant so that it's not touching the glass. Keep the terrarium in bright, indirect light. Water lightly when the soil begins to dry out. Remove faded flowers and any leaves that show signs of fungus, mildew or other problems. In a humid terrarium, diseases and pests can spread fast.\n- For another unique look, use air plants in an open container. They need air and small amounts of water that they absorb through their leaves. They don’t need soil, so just put them inside the terrarium and mist them a few times each week. In hot weather, take them out once a week and soak them in a bowl of water for an hour or two. In cold weather, mist them a few times each week. Soak them about every two to three weeks. Use rainwater, purified water or tap water that can stand for 24 hours so the chlorine can evaporate.\n- Keep your air plants in bright, indirect light and they may bloom for you."}

Vinyl planks can be sorted into three main categories based on their installation method: GripStrip, click-lock and glue down.\n- [GripStrip vinyl plank flooring](/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/Grip-Strip/N-5yc1vZbzjzZ1z1ak2p) has a manufacturer-applied adhesive layer that connects the planks to one another. This installation method creates a floating floor, which means GripStrip vinyl planking covers the subfloor without adhering or fastening to it in any manner. Floating floors are an easy, mess-free way to install new flooring without necessarily having to remove the existing flooring.\n- [Interlocking vinyl plank flooring](/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/Click-Lock/N-5yc1vZbzjzZ1z1ajwk), also known as click-lock, creates a floating floor. But instead of having an adhesive connecting the planks, the planks interlock with tongue-and-groove joints that easily snap together for a reliable fit.\n- [Glue down vinyl plank flooring](/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/Adhesive/N-5yc1vZbzjzZ1z1ak5j) adheres to the subfloor using either one of two types of adhesives: hard-set or pressure-sensitive adhesives. Hard-set adhesive is spread along the subfloor, and then the vinyl planks are laid down on top. Pressure-sensitive adhesive is already on the bottom of the plank and bonds to the subfloor when the plank is pressed into place. While both types of adhesives are durable, the pressure-sensitive adhesive can make replacing individual vinyl planks easier.\n- All three installation methods are suitable for novices, require little time and can be laid over any rigid and level subfloor. Which method you choose depends on personal preference and the room you are planning to renovate. When choosing between floating floor options, note that GripStrip vinyl plank flooring is often water-resistant, while click-lock vinyl plank flooring can be entirely waterproof."}

Place painter’s tape in short, overlapping strips for more control and best coverage.\n- If you have a textured ceiling and are painting only the walls, run a screwdriver along the ceiling's edge. This creates a small, unnoticeable, texture-free surface for the painter's tape to adhere to. It is then easier to create a straight paint edge.\n- If you're painting an accent wall, mask off the inside edge of the wall from the rest of the room."}

And you know what I always say, “a shower can never have too many shelves”- just kidding, I never say that. But really, I do like a lot of shelves in the shower so soap and shampoo bottles don’t end up on the floor.\n- We installed three of these cool [corner shelves](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Bath-Accessories-White-8-in-x-8-in-Ceramic-Wall-Mounted-Corner-Shelf-0100BA7801P/100674432). I’m not going to lie, I was intimidated by these shelves when I first saw them. They are pretty heavy duty, and I thought there was no way they were going to stay on the wall with just thinset. But I was wrong! They are really amazing and super easy to install.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-12.jpg)\n- The shelf actually sits on the tile below it, and the tile above it slides behind the shelf, so it stays put! When we got to the row where we wanted the shelf, we installed the shelf first, with a layer of thinset, then tiled the row meeting up to it. That way we knew exactly what size to cut our tile. We did have to cut a couple of tiles in sort of an L-shape to have it fit up to the shelf, but the coolest part is that the tile slides in behind the shelf, so you can’t see the edge of the cut tile behind it.\n- Our bottom shelf was installed about 2 feet from the shower floor, and the top shelves just shy of 4 feet from the shower floor.\n- We were big fans of [these shelves](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Bath-Accessories-White-8-in-x-8-in-Ceramic-Wall-Mounted-Corner-Shelf-0100BA7801P/100674432)."}

Once we were ready to tile the walls, we put down some cardboard so we didn’t drip thinset on our floor tiles. We used 3×12 [Daltile Subway Tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Restore-Bright-White-3-in-x-12-in-Ceramic-Subway-Wall-Tile-12-sq-ft-Case-RE15312HD1P2/302872669) in bright white for our walls. The price on these tiles was so good! They give a lot of bang for their buck. We started by laying the back wall. We centered our first tile in the center of our back wall, then we tiled out and up from there.\n- You will spread a layer of [thinset](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-VersaBond-White-50-lbs-Fortified-Thinset-Mortar-MTSW50/100091767) with the notched side of your [trowel](https://www.homedepot.com/p/HDX-9-in-x-3-8-in-x-1-4-in-Square-Notch-Economy-Flooring-Trowel-10114X/203713870), then lay your tile. Make to keep the tiles level. Since the shower pan is sloped, you want to make sure you use a [2 foot level](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Measuring-Tools-Levels/N-5yc1vZc1zh), and check every so often to make sure you are keeping your tiles level. We used [1/8″ tile spacers](https://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-1-8-in-Tile-Spacers-1-000-pack-10281Q/100191220) to keep our tiles spaced and even.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-11.jpg)\n- You’ll want to start on the wall you look at straight on, then move to your side walls, that way you won’t see your grout lines. So after we got our first row done on our back wall, we moved to our side walls. Since we didn’t really care if the tiles on those walls were centered, we started with half of a tile and worked our way outward. Then on the next row, we started with a whole tile. We continued that pattern upward."}

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 2: Things to Consider\n- New Home or New-to-You Home: If you move into a new home, don’t assume the carpet is clean and move-in ready. We recommend a deep carpet cleaning session. This will remove excess debris from construction, foot traffic or previous residents.\n- Rent vs. Buy: If you live in a large household with children or pets, purchase a carpet cleaner you can use at any time. For those in smaller households with less storage and less foot traffic, or those who rent their home, renting home carpet cleaners may be a great option.\n- Tools, Accessories and Features: If you have a lot of furniture, area rugs or stairs, choose a carpet cleaner with accessories. An extended hose, upholstery tools and crevice tools are all helpful. Consider additional features like separate tanks for water and [floor cleaning products](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Floor-Care-Floor-Cleaning-Products/N-5yc1vZbzju). These eliminate the need for manual-mixing and can save time.\n- Maintenance: A carpet cleaning machine must also be cleaned. The machines with removable brushes, tools and hoses are easier to maintain than those that you need to lift, turn upside down or reach deep inside of to clean.\n- Tank-Size: The larger the tank, the more space you can clean with your machine. It will decrease the amount of times you will need to change out the water.\n- Proper Ventilation: Even the best home carpet cleaners can be loud, and some cleaners can also exude fumes. Be sure to open a window while cleaning and always wear ear protection."}

Use a 2-inch nylon-polyester [paint brush](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Brushes/N-5yc1vZarac) or corner pad to apply primer at all corners or places where walls, moulding and ceilings meet.\n- Next, brush primer on areas of walls and trim that need special attention.

You’ll need grout (of course), a [grout float](https://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-4-in-x-9-1-2-in-Gum-Rubber-Grout-Float-with-Traditional-Wooden-Handle-and-Non-Stick-Gum-Rubber-10061Q/100187695), a 5 gallon [homer bucket](https://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Home-Depot-5-gal-Homer-Bucket-PN0110/300247902) of clean water, and a sponge. I swear by [these sponges](https://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-7-1-2-in-x-5-1-4-in-Extra-Large-Grouting-Scrubbing-Cleaning-and-Washing-Sponge-70007Q-24/202329544) with the scrubber thing on one side. It really helps if you let the grout sit for a little too long before wiping it off.\n- I also used premixed [Fusion Pro grout in Natural Gray](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-Fusion-Pro-09-Natural-Gray-1-qt-Single-Component-Grout-FP09QT-4/205741434) (#09).\n- I decided to go with this grout because it never needs sealing, which is so nice! And I went with the premixed, because I wanted to be sure I had the right consistency.\n- Please note that I am an incredibly messy grouter- my whole grouting process could have gone a lot faster if I’d have stayed cleaner with my grout.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-14.jpg)\n- When you are grouting, you want to start with your walls first, then go to your floor. Basically you smear the grout on with your float and make sure it smooshes into your spaces between the tiles. Then you go behind and wipe the excess grout with a clean, wet sponge. You’ll want to make sure you keep your water and your sponge clean. Once you have your tile pretty clean, you can let the grout sit for a few hours and cure. Then go back with a clean, wet sponge and give it a really good wipe down. If you didn’t get the Fusion Pro grout, you will have to seal it after the grout cures completely.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-15.jpg)\n- Make sure you grout right up to your Schluter tile edging. You’ll want to make sure there aren’t any gaps at all. Also, the grout will stick to the Schluter tile edging, so make sure to wipe it down really well while it’s wet, or you’ll spend a lot of time scraping dried grout off later. Don’t ask me how I know that! haha!\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-16.jpg)\n- And make sure you clean your corners out really well. Your grout will tend to pool in the corners, so use a putty knife or the corner of your float to get the excess grout out of the corners and out from under the shelves.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-17.jpg)"}

Scrape away any excess and wait until repairs dry before moving to the next step.\n- Take time to repair the grout around the tiles as well. Little flaws can be fixed with a small amount of grout from a tube. Wear gloves and use your finger to rub in the grout. Wipe any extra off with a cloth.

Begin by measuring the length of each wall and calculating the dimensions for your box trim.\n- Consider factors like spacing and preferred height for each box trim element. For instance, I aimed for a 5-inch spacing gap from walls and baseboards, with a desired lower box trim height of 20 inches.\n- Using these preferences, I calculated the height of the upper box trim by subtracting the total spacing gaps from the ceiling height, minus the height of the lower box trim. This gave me a height of 68 inches for each piece. To calculate the width, subtract the total wall width from the number of spacing gaps, then divide by the desired number of box trim designs.\n- For example, on my 98-inch-wide wall, I wanted two box trim designs. So, subtracting 15 inches for gaps, I divided the remaining 83 inches by two, resulting in 41.5 inches for each box trim width. Apply these width calculations consistently across all walls for uniformity."}

I used [pre-pasted wallpaper](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Magnolia-Home-by-Joanna-Gaines-The-Daily-Paper-Strippable-Roll-Wallpaper-Covers-56-sq-ft-MH1508/301440074 \"Magnolia Home by Joanna Gaines The Daily Paper Strippable Roll Wallpaper \\(Covers 56 sq. ft.\\)\") which was fairly easy to work with. Simply spray the back with water and like magic, it activates the paste! Start in an inconspicuous corner. The reason for this is that when you have wallpapered the entire room, there is a high probability that the seams will not line up properly between the first piece laid and the last piece. Also, always make sure your first piece is completely level, as it is the template that you will be basing your entire room on. Make sure you get wallpaper smoother and razor blade to smooth it out and cut off excess wallpaper. PRO TIP: Always order EXTRA wallpaper, because running out is no fun! And you can always return any roles that you do not use. For the vertical boards as well as the floor trim, I used one-by-six trim boards. I decided to use my sprayer to spray these all at once. Next, I installed my floor trim in which I used a miter saw to create my 45-degree cuts. After the floor trim was installed, I was ready to install my vertical boards. I highly suggest laying them out before installing them. I used a spare board as a spacer to make sure they were evenly distributed. I like to measure each board vs. cutting them all the same size, because my walls are usually not level. Installing them was simple, I just used my brad nailer!\n- ![A close-up of the wallpaper.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/mXEoZdGXS7QVV1Zm8VfXwQ/5e7TwZ14RfHnjSht0VoxuQ/Original%20file/JordanMiller-JordanMillerHome-FY24HDC-BasementBathroomMakeover-BlogPhoto-12.jpg)"}

Use a scraper or putty knife to loosen an edge of the wallpaper at the corner of a room and carefully try to pull off a strip. Removable wallpaper should peel off easily.\n- Strippable wallpaper is designed to last longer than removable wallpaper, but softens easily when soaked with hot water.\n- Wallpapers designed to be water resistant or washable, such as vinyl wallpapers, need a stronger method, such as a chemical [wallpaper remover](/b/Paint-Wallpaper-Remover/N-5yc1vZ2fkot80).\n- Gel removers are less messy than liquid removers and can be more effective in removing wallpaper that has been applied to unprimed drywall or has used clay-based adhesives.\n- Wallpaper steamers can be used on any wallpaper and may be the only recourse with old, stubborn wallpapers that are hard to remove. Buying or renting a steamer may be more expensive than other methods."}

Find the center of the room, then using your chalk and straightedge, strike a line.\n- Strike a second line at a right angle from the first line, dividing your room into four equal  \n- Measure the distance from the center point to the wall, parallel to the direction of the plank. Divide the measurement by the width of the plank. If the last plank needs to be shorter than half its width, move the center point as needed so the plank should be trimmed no more than half its original width.\n- Apply the manufacturer-recommended adhesive to the subfloor with a trowel, starting at the center point and working outward  \n- Allow the adhesive to set somewhat until it is tacky but still cloudy/hazy in color. Do not allow the adhesive to rest so long that it becomes clear.\n- If the adhesive gets on the top surface of a vinyl plank, immediately wipe it away with a dry cloth before it can dry.\n- Place the first plank with its short edge at the junction of the two chalk lines.\n- Continue to lay the planks row by row, working along the parallel chalk line and ensuring the edges of each plank fit tightly against the neighboring plank.\n- Trim the border planks as needed, leaving manufacturer-recommended expansion space.\n- Most glue down vinyl plank flooring needs to be rolled with a floor roller after installation to firmly and evenly seat the vinyl planks into the adhesive. Wipe away or use a knife to peel away any adhesive that gets into the seams between planks.\n- Replace the baseboard."}

Murphy beds and wheeled desks are some examples. Storage should be available and can be either built-in, in the form of portable containers or furniture that doubles as storage – think storage ottomans and baskets. Paint and décor should complement most colors so it’s easy to repurpose the room at any time.\n- Flex rooms that will be multifunctional can use shelves or screens to divide it into sections. Consider painting walls or using decor with colors that complement all sections of the room. This will help it look cohesive.\n- Your flex room can be a spare room in your home, or you may be inspired to build an area.

A clean surface ensures a better seal. Use a general cleaner to remove dirt, mold or mildew. Let the wood surfaces dry completely before proceeding to the next step. If it’s a new wood surface, you can skip the cleaning process.\n- Sand down wood: After the surface is dry, give it a good sanding with rough sandpaper or with a [sander](/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Sanders/N-5yc1vZc28s) to tackle any imperfections. Finish with finer sandpaper to make it smooth and even. Wipe the surface thoroughly to remove any sanding residue.\n- Choose the right stain or sealant: Most sealants and stains are sold for the application you need it for. Pick the one that makes sense for your surface.\n- Apply the first coat: Apply the sealant or stain evenly with your brush or sprayer. Allow the surface to dry for four to ten hours, depending on the product's instructions.\n- Sand the surface: To form an effective waterproof barrier, you will have to apply multiple coats of stain or sealant. Sanding between coats will allow the next layer to adhere better. Use very fine sandpaper or “0000” steel wool to sand the surface. Wipe the surface down again with a dry cloth to prepare it for the second coat.\n- Apply the next coat: Add another layer of stain or sealant and let it dry for four to ten hours. Sand and apply waterproofing again, if necessary.\n- Let it cure: The wood needs to cure for around three days before using it or placing any furniture on top of it."}

If the opening is narrow, put them on a paper plate and fold them into a funnel shape. Put the tip of the funnel into the neck of the container and gently shake the pebbles out. If you don’t have a paper plate, use a few sheets of newspaper. The pebbles will let excess water drain away from the plants. If plant roots sit in water, they won’t get enough oxygen and will die.\n- Put a light layer of activated charcoal chips over the pebbles. Stores that carry pet and fish supplies will likely have this charcoal. It will help absorb odors that can build up over time, especially in closed terrariums.\n- Add a layer of moss over the charcoal to help keep the charcoal from floating when you water the plants.

These are actually calcium salt deposits or efflorescence that water brings to the surface. This must be removed before applying a new coat of sealant.  \n- Look for holes and cracks: If there are no holes or cracks in the surface, it's ready for waterproofing. If a surface shows signs of damage, repair the holes or large cracks before applying waterproofer.\n- Remove existing paint: If there’s paint or other coatings on the masonry, remove it by scraping, sandblasting, sanding, wire-brushing, pressure washing, chemicals or a combination. You can use [paint stripper and remover](/b/Paint-Paint-Strippers-Removers/N-5yc1vZc5bq) to expedite the process. Masonry sealant only adheres to bare masonry. You have to remove the paint before applying the sealer.\n- Clean the surface: Use a pressure washer or cleaning solution to remove mold, mildew and dirt from the surface. Allow it to completely dry.\n- Repair the surface: Repair hairline cracks with waterproofing mix. Repair larger cracks by cleaning out and patching with mortar.\n- Mist the area: Finely spray the masonry before applying waterproofer.\n- Apply the sealant: Paint masonry surface with a thick coat of sealant. Be sure to push the sealant into cracks and crevices of surface. A paint roller or brush made specifically for masonry is best.\n- Let it dry: Allow to dry overnight or for a minimum of 12 hours between coats.\n- Apply a second coat: Apply another coat of sealant and allow it to dry.\n- Paint: Now you can paint the surface any color you want. Remember, if you need to re-apply sealant in a few years, you will have to remove that paint layer."}

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 9: Wood Stain Types\n- ![A dual image of water based- and oil-based wood stain.](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-stain-wood-2022-step-8.jpg)\n- Types of wood stains include oil-based, water-based and gel-based. Use safety equipment and follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using any wood stain. Don’t mix different types of stains while working on a project.\n- If you’re focusing on how to stain a wood table or other large pieces of furniture, oil-based stain is typically a good choice. Because they take more time to dry, [oil-based wood stains](/b/Paint-Interior-Wood-Stains/Oil-Based/N-5yc1vZbo8pZ1z1p6ug) come out more evenly. They’re also more durable. Oil-based stains contain harsh chemicals. Work outdoors or in a well-ventilated space, like a room with the windows open.\n- To clean rags and brushes used with oil-based stain, use mineral spirits. Follow the manufacturer’s safety instructions when working with mineral spirits, especially when it comes to disposing of the rags you use. When not dried and properly discarded, they can burst into flames.\n- Water-based stains dry quickly and work well for smaller projects. Because they penetrate the surface, water-based stains raise the grain of the wood. Water-based stains are more environmentally friendly than oil-based ones, though you should still take safety precautions. Also, all you need to clean up after using water-based stain is soap and water.\n- Gel-based stains are a cross between a wood stain and paint. These stains are thicker and provide better control of the color. They are messier to work with than water-based or oil-based products. To clean up after using gel-based stains, use mineral spirits.\n- Learning how to apply wood stain provides an alternative to painting a piece of furniture while emphasizing its natural color and texture. When using interior wood stains, mastering how to apply stain can give any wood surface a whole new look.\n- As you figure out how to stain wood, remember that stains add color, but don’t protect the wood. To prevent damage from water, light and everyday use, you’ll need to add a finish to the wood.\n- To find all the stains you need to complete your project, shop using [The Home Depot Mobile App](https://www.homedepot.com/c/SF_Mobile_Shopping)."}

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 4: How to Remove Wallpaper With Liquid\n- Before using liquid remover, water-resistant wallpaper should be scored or perforated so the remover will be able to contact the adhesive between the paper and the wall. Roller-style wallpaper scorers are extremely effective at puncturing the wallpaper with dozens of tiny holes. Use light pressure when running the scorer over the wall to avoid scratching the wall. Blade-based wallpaper scorers are cheaper but slice lines into the wallpaper and are less effective.\n- Apply the liquid remover with a spray bottle for quick coverage over a larger area, but use a sponge or other tool in corners or places where precision is required.\n- Allow the solution to soak the wall as specified by the manufacturer’s instructions.\n- Once the liquid remover has softened the adhesive, peel off the paper or use a [paint scraper](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Tools-Paint-Scrapers/Paint-Scrapers/N-5yc1vZci29Z1z0t5dr) or putty knife to remove it."}

If you don't use primer, they can absorb paint unevenly. You might end up adding more coats of paint than you planned to.\n- On walls that are already painted with a glossy finish, or when using latex paint on top of an oil-based finish, a new coat of paint applied directly on top might have trouble adhering without a coat of primer for it to hold onto.\n- When painting over a dark-colored wall, a coat or two of primer provides a clean and neutral canvas for a lighter paint color to refresh your room.\n- Primer is typically less expensive than paint. Using primer instead of several coats of new paint may lower the cost of your paint job.\n- Primer works well to cover previous paint colors and flaws or spots on the wall. But if your walls are in great shape and the new coat of paint is a similar color to the old one, you may not need primer."}

Scraps of drywall also work fine to practice on. Take your time learning how to use a paint sprayer and have several pieces of scrap material on hand.\n- Try various vertical and horizontal spraying movements to get a consistent pattern of paint onto the surface of the scrap material. You want the surface to achieve a uniform look when using a paint sprayer.\n- Holding the spray gun close to a surface applies more paint and creates a narrower spray pattern. Practice holding the spray gun closer to the surface for that result.\n- Holding the gun farther away from the surface creates a thinner coat of paint and a wider spray pattern. Work on how to use a paint sprayer to create that result, as well.\n- If you hold the sprayer too far away, the paint can dry before it reaches the surface. If that happens, you might need to respray the surface and take even more time to complete the project. Also, your paint supply won’t last as long."}

Find the center of the room, then using your chalk and straightedge, strike a line.\n- Strike a second line at a right angle from the first line, dividing your room into four equal  \n- Measure the distance from the center point to the wall, parallel to the direction of the plank. Divide the measurement by the width of the plank. If the last plank needs to be shorter than half its width, move the center point as needed so the plank should be trimmed no more than half its original width.\n- Apply the manufacturer-recommended adhesive to the subfloor with a trowel, starting at the center point and working outward  \n- Allow the adhesive to set somewhat until it is tacky but still cloudy/hazy in color. Do not allow the adhesive to rest so long that it becomes clear.\n- If the adhesive gets on the top surface of a vinyl plank, immediately wipe it away with a dry cloth before it can dry.\n- Place the first plank with its short edge at the junction of the two chalk lines.\n- Continue to lay the planks row by row, working along the parallel chalk line and ensuring the edges of each plank fit tightly against the neighboring plank.\n- Trim the border planks as needed, leaving manufacturer-recommended expansion space.\n- Most glue down vinyl plank flooring needs to be rolled with a floor roller after installation to firmly and evenly seat the vinyl planks into the adhesive. Wipe away or use a knife to peel away any adhesive that gets into the seams between planks.\n- Replace the baseboard."}

However, using an orderly process can save time and effort. Painting a room in the correct order will also reduce drips and runs. A good rule of thumb is to always start with the ceiling. Next, paint the walls and end by painting baseboards, windows and door trim.\n- Tip: Maintain efficiency by getting enough paint.

Before you start adding the pattern to your tiles, practice stencil painting on a piece of cardboard.  \n- Start with a clean tile floor. Priming the tile will help the stencil paint stick to it.\n- Plan the pattern so it will match the tiled space you want to paint. Use painter’s tape to cover the edges of the area.\n- Begin stenciling on one of the edges. Work on one tile at a time. Lay the stencil on the tile. Use painter’s tape to secure the stencil. You can apply the paint with a brush or a sponge.  \n- The key to pretty stenciling is using the right amount of paint. Dab a little paint onto the stencil and tile at a time, adding more if you need to.\n- When you’re done painting the pattern, allow plenty of time to let it dry. Depending on how you’re working, you may need to let one stencil dry before adding the next."}

Drying refers to evaporation of the water or solvents in the paint. It will feel dry to the touch. Curing, on the other hand, is when the paint has completed its chemical bonding with the surface. At this point, it will have reached maximum hardness.\n- While paint is curing, the surface shouldn’t be used. If it’s a floor, for example, it shouldn’t be walked on yet.\n- Read the paint can’s instructions for drying time between coats. Curing takes much longer and depends on the type of paint. Both drying and curing depend on the paint, the thickness of the layer(s), the ambient temperature and humidity, ventilation/air circulation and other exterior factors. Curing can take anywhere from four to 30 days."}

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 11: Using a Paint Sprayer\n- When picking a paint, it should flow smoothly through the sprayer. Airless paint sprayer rentals use oil-based paints. They’re better than latex or water-based paints, which can be thicker and clog machines.\n- Have all necessary painting tools and equipment ready before starting a project. Besides the normal materials, you may need special items. For instance, a fiberglass twin stepladder or scaffold set may help for higher walls and ceilings. If you have to paint large, open indoor areas, such as warehouses, The Home Depot has scissor lifts for rent that can rise up to 40 feet.\n- Be sure to follow the sprayer’s operations manual for all steps. Practice first, using a piece of scrap drywall or cardboard. This will allow you to use the sprayer correctly, using a smooth, back-and-forth motion. You can also figure out the distance needed for proper coverage.\n- Always begin your stroke movement before using the trigger to release paint. Then, end the stroke after releasing the trigger. Doing this prevents paint from building up on the surface. Regularly wiping your paint sprayer nozzle with a rag prevents clogging.\n- When using a sprayer, first paint corners and complex areas. You can then move on to flat surfaces, working top to bottom.\n- Once your project is completed, let the paint dry for 24-48 hours. Next, remove the painter’s tape and drop cloths. You can then move your furniture back into the room and continue designing.\n- Make sure you return your paint sprayer rental clean. When finished, clean the entire paint sprayer, as per the operations manual. If work remains, pour the leftover paint back into the can and clean the machine before storing."}

You can use a vacuum so long as the vacuum doesn’t have a beater bar or has a “bare floor” setting. Otherwise, the vacuum may scuff the floor.\n- Mop as needed or whenever the floors begin to look dull. Use a mop that’s damp, but not soaking wet to avoid water damage. Use a soft towel to dry any spots that are still wet a few minutes after mopping.\n- Clean up spills and any water on the floor as soon as possible.\n- For deep cleanings, use a [cleaner](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Supplies-Floor-Cleaners-Hardwood-Floor-Cleaners/N-5yc1vZcb40) that's safe for engineered wood flooring. Follow the cleaner’s manufacturer’s instructions for the best results.\n- Don’t use cleaning products with ammonia, wax or oil.\n- Use only soft materials like a towel or microfiber cleaning cloth when applying cleaner to your floor.\n- Minimize the appearance of scratches and prevent more damage using a scratch concealer made for engineered wood flooring.\n- Consider putting rugs, mats or felt furniture sliders underneath chairs or other frequently used furniture to prevent scuffs and scratches on your floor."}

Also, make sure you check your tiles CONSTANTLY to assure you have what we call “the flower” or else you could end up with a floor that shows the square sheets of penny tile. I removed the tiles, added thinset and secured them row by row until the entire room was done. I let this dry overnight. For the letters, I first placed the [black penny tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/p/MSI-Nero-Penny-Round-12-in-x-13-in-Matte-Porcelain-Mesh-Mounted-Mosaic-Tile-14-4-sq-ft-case-PT-PENRD-NEROM/306065589 \"MSI Nero Penny Round 12 in. x 13 in.

Then I marked each of the white tiles with a little dot, so I knew which ones to remove. I used a flat head screwdriver and popped up the marked tiles. Once they were up, I cleaned out any excess dried thinset. I then added the black penny tiles. To do this, I put thinset into a Ziplock bag and cut the tip (like you would apply icing on a cake). This allowed me to squeeze out a little on each tile and press onto the floor. Read the label on your thinset to determine how long it needs to dry before grouting. Once dry, you are ready for [grout](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-SimpleGrout-640-Arctic-White-1-gal-Pre-Mixed-Grout-PMG6401-2/319229605 \"Custom Building Products SimpleGrout #640 Arctic White 1 gal.

Using a [grout float](https://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-4-in-x-10-5-in-XL-Non-Stick-Gum-Rubber-Grout-Float-with-Wood-Handle-10070/310829257 \"QEP 4 in. x 10.5 in. XL Non-Stick Gum Rubber Grout Float with Wood Handle\"), scoop the grout out and press it into the tile. Make sure you angle the grout float to remove excess grout. Do this in small areas as you do not want to leave the grout on the tile for too long. Use water and sponges to wipe off any remaining excess grout. Also, be sure to refresh your water constantly, if it looks “milky” the grout could adhere to the top of your tile, making your end project look very messy. Once the entire floor is grouted, refer to the products suggested drying time. If you have any grout haze, you can use a grout haze remover. Once you’re happy with the look of your tile and grout, go ahead and seal it.\n- ![A person installing the penny tiles on the floor.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/Get04AiI_hhkQ_AWjP-9mg/S_FOfFEsy9PEaiHtJSpfzQ/Original%20file/JordanMiller-JordanMillerHome-FY24HDC-BasementBathroomMakeover-BlogPhoto-7.jpg)![A close-up of the penny tiles.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/X6-2w68MB1sAygMbGETzrQ/2Pg_-ClPwDX3RZ8-MvVUHg/Original%20file/JordanMiller-JordanMillerHome-FY24HDC-BasementBathroomMakeover-BlogPhoto-8.jpg)![Overview of the penny tiles during the installation.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/VSeCtCxOF8VbmQIJbOW8WA/ozUtMzqFJ2izsbCvrTx8dQ/Original%20file/JordanMiller-JordanMillerHome-FY24HDC-BasementBathroomMakeover-BlogPhoto-9.jpg)![Overview of the completed penny tiles.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/228pTeLLgK8oXaxVjA9jmg/nwCUzrc8iSCtr4486GrLZw/Original%20file/JordanMiller-JordanMillerHome-FY24HDC-BasementBathroomMakeover-BlogPhoto-10.jpg)"}

Airflow efficiency is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air being moved. Fans either come with a [DC motor](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/DC-Motor/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z0sd38) or an AC motor. DC motors tend to produce less heat and consume less energy than heavier AC motors.\n- Fans with high CFM, or airflow efficiency, are perfect for outdoor spaces or garages because they will circulate more air and can help keep away insects and pests.\n- If energy-efficiency is at the top of your must-have list, look for an [Energy Star rated fan](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans-Ceiling-Fans-With-Lights/Energy-Star/N-5yc1vZcjnuZ1z0ksr7). These certified ceiling fans use up to 20 percent less energy. Energy Star-certified ceiling fans can help reduce your heating and cooling costs.\n- It's important to note that dirty fan blades will not have a high airflow efficiency, so be sure to dust your ceiling fans often.\n- Tip: In the summer, run your fan counterclockwise for a cool breeze. In the winter, run your fan clockwise to push down warm air circulating near the ceiling to better distribute the heat throughout the room.\n- You can change the fan direction using a switch on the motor housing or a button on the fan remote.\n- From learning how to measure for a ceiling fan to finding the best outdoor ceiling fans for your patio, we are here to help.

Typically, they measure between 72 inches and 96 inches, with 84 inches being the average.\n- Longer or bigger sofas: Taller people may prefer these pieces, measuring 87 inches to 100 inches or more in length.\n- Smaller sofas: Also called “apartment sofas,” they have less depth and length, which is great for smaller spaces.\n- Loveseats: Designed for two people, they measure between 48 inches and 72 inches, typically averaging about 52 inches to 66 inches. You may want to pair a loveseat with a couch, arranging them in an L-shaped configuration in your living room. Manufacturers typically classify loveseat dimensions like larger sofas.\n- Sofa depth: This measures the piece front to back. Most types of couches run 32 inches to 40 inches in depth, with 35 inches being the average.\n- Sofa height: This measures the distance from the couch top to the floor, usually 26 inches to 36 inches. It determines if your feet will rest on the ground.\n- Seat height: This measures the distance from the top of a couch’s seat cushion to the floor. It usually runs 15 inches to 20 inches, averaging 17 to 18 inches.\n- Seat depth: This measures the seat’s front to either its back edge or the sofa back. As this can affect posture, people of average height may prefer standard seat depths of 21 inches or 22 inches. Deep-seat sofas, with depths of 28 inches to 35 inches or more, are also available."}

You’ll need grout (of course), a [grout float](https://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-4-in-x-9-1-2-in-Gum-Rubber-Grout-Float-with-Traditional-Wooden-Handle-and-Non-Stick-Gum-Rubber-10061Q/100187695), a 5 gallon [homer bucket](https://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Home-Depot-5-gal-Homer-Bucket-PN0110/300247902) of clean water, and a sponge. I swear by [these sponges](https://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-7-1-2-in-x-5-1-4-in-Extra-Large-Grouting-Scrubbing-Cleaning-and-Washing-Sponge-70007Q-24/202329544) with the scrubber thing on one side. It really helps if you let the grout sit for a little too long before wiping it off.\n- I also used premixed [Fusion Pro grout in Natural Gray](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-Fusion-Pro-09-Natural-Gray-1-qt-Single-Component-Grout-FP09QT-4/205741434) (#09).\n- I decided to go with this grout because it never needs sealing, which is so nice! And I went with the premixed, because I wanted to be sure I had the right consistency.\n- Please note that I am an incredibly messy grouter- my whole grouting process could have gone a lot faster if I’d have stayed cleaner with my grout.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-14.jpg)\n- When you are grouting, you want to start with your walls first, then go to your floor. Basically you smear the grout on with your float and make sure it smooshes into your spaces between the tiles. Then you go behind and wipe the excess grout with a clean, wet sponge. You’ll want to make sure you keep your water and your sponge clean. Once you have your tile pretty clean, you can let the grout sit for a few hours and cure. Then go back with a clean, wet sponge and give it a really good wipe down. If you didn’t get the Fusion Pro grout, you will have to seal it after the grout cures completely.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-15.jpg)\n- Make sure you grout right up to your Schluter tile edging. You’ll want to make sure there aren’t any gaps at all. Also, the grout will stick to the Schluter tile edging, so make sure to wipe it down really well while it’s wet, or you’ll spend a lot of time scraping dried grout off later. Don’t ask me how I know that! haha!\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-16.jpg)\n- And make sure you clean your corners out really well. Your grout will tend to pool in the corners, so use a putty knife or the corner of your float to get the excess grout out of the corners and out from under the shelves.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-17.jpg)"}

Painting tile is much easier than installing tile.\n- You won’t have to take out the old tile or figure out how to dispose of it.\n- Getting ready to paint tile includes making minor repairs to your existing tile, which can improve its appearance.\n- Paint doesn’t last as long as the finish on tile. The paint you apply may come off over the years. Paint might not be the best option for high traffic tile, such as floors.\n- Similarly, painting tiles in a shower, painting tiles in the bathroom, or painting any other tiles that get wet often may be inefficient.\n- When you paint tile, the grout will be painted over, too. You’ll no longer see the contrast between the grout and tile.\n- You need to do a thorough job of cleaning and repairing the tile before you get started.\n- While the paint dries, you may not be able to use the room the tile is in."}

We started with the shower floor. Because I didn’t want to have to cut tiles to match the slope of the shower pan, I used these adorable little [penny tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Finesse-Glossy-White-12-in-x-13-in-x-6-35-mm-Porcelain-Penny-Round-Mosaic-Wall-Tile-1-06-sq-ft-piece-FE0811PNYRDHD1P/300049525). Installing them was really easy. I started by cutting one edge of the tiles with my [wet saw](/b/Flooring-Flooring-Supplies-Flooring-Tools-Tile-Tools-Tile-Saws/N-5yc1vZcdt8), so the edge was square and even.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-7.jpg)\n- Then I started laying in the back corner, working my way across the back wall and then forward. You will spread a layer of [thinset](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-VersaBond-White-50-lbs-Fortified-Thinset-Mortar-MTSW50/100091767) with the notched side of your [trowel](https://www.homedepot.com/p/HDX-9-in-x-3-8-in-x-1-4-in-Square-Notch-Economy-Flooring-Trowel-10114X/203713870), then lay your tile. Take your time on these penny tiles. Because you don’t use spacers, you’ll need to be very deliberate and careful to make sure everything stays straight and level. You’ll also need to cut the tile to fit your drain. We used an [angle grinder](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-18-Volt-ONE-Cordless-4-1-2-in-Angle-Grinder-Tool-Only-P421/100519983) to cut the tiles so they fit perfectly around the drain.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-8.jpg)"}

Next, I patched all my holes. You will want to patch any holes or imperfections with spackle, let dry, repeat if needed and sand until smooth. Even if you are covering the walls with wallpaper, they need to be smooth first, otherwise you will see imperfections through the wallpaper. After patching, make sure to prime your walls. Wallpaper will not stick to drywall or spackle. If you are painting your walls, you will still need to prime to ensure the paint covers evenly. You’ll want to check the condition of the subfloor to ensure it’s in good shape before moving on to your new flooring choice. Since we are working in the basement, I’m dealing with concrete so that makes it easy on me! Since there was carpet in this bathroom a zillion years ago (gross I know), I did have to scrape up some residue. I used my [Husky 15-in-one tool](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-15-in-1-Painters-Multi-Tool-with-Stainless-Steel-Blade-91004/326354449 \"Husky 15-in-1 Painters Multi-Tool with Stainless Steel Blade\") and everything came up easily."}

A good gel should liquefy the adhesive without softening or soaking the face of the drywall.\n- Use a spray bottle, brush or roller to apply and let sit for 20 to 30 minutes so it can soak in.\n- After the gel has soaked the wallpaper, use a scraper to peel up the wallpaper in strips."}

When deciding what color to paint them, take into consideration all the other aspects in the room such as tile, countertop colors, light fixtures, and cabinet pulls. Don’t work against it all, work with it.\n- I chose Behr MARQUEE [White paint](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-MARQUEE-1-gal-Ultra-Pure-White-Matte-Interior-Paint-and-Primer-in-One-145001/204747469) for the wall cabinets . For the island, I decided to change it up and go with a real dark navy blue color, called [Winter Way](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-MARQUEE-1-gal-PPU25-23-Winter-Way-Satin-Enamel-Interior-Paint-and-Primer-in-One-745301/300007622). I loved the way it looked with my grey island countertop and it surprisingly went really nice with the black countertops on the wall cabinets.\n- I removed all the cabinet doors, cleaned, [sanded](/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Sanders/N-5yc1vZc28s) and de-glossed them, and then painted them all in my garage with a [foam brush roller](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Rollers/N-5yc1vZaqpy). I was going to spray them, but MARQUEE brand recommends not using an air powered sprayer, which is what I have.\n- The colors went great with my current cabinet pulls. I debated whether I should get new ones, but sometimes, by picking the correct colors, it can completely change the look of them. That’s exactly what happened here. I thought they looked too outdated and rustic for the space, but against the white and blue, the copper undertone stood out. This is where the next choice came into play."}

Use safety equipment and follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using any wood stain. Don’t mix different types of stains while working on a project.\n- If you’re focusing on how to stain a wood table or other large pieces of furniture, oil-based stain is typically a good choice. Because they take more time to dry, [oil-based wood stains](/b/Paint-Interior-Wood-Stains/Oil-Based/N-5yc1vZbo8pZ1z1p6ug) come out more evenly. They’re also more durable. Oil-based stains contain harsh chemicals. Work outdoors or in a well-ventilated space, like a room with the windows open.\n- To clean rags and brushes used with oil-based stain, use mineral spirits. Follow the manufacturer’s safety instructions when working with mineral spirits, especially when it comes to disposing of the rags you use. When not dried and properly discarded, they can burst into flames.\n- Water-based stains dry quickly and work well for smaller projects. Because they penetrate the surface, water-based stains raise the grain of the wood. Water-based stains are more environmentally friendly than oil-based ones, though you should still take safety precautions. Also, all you need to clean up after using water-based stain is soap and water.\n- Gel-based stains are a cross between a wood stain and paint. These stains are thicker and provide better control of the color. They are messier to work with than water-based or oil-based products. To clean up after using gel-based stains, use mineral spirits.\n- Learning how to apply wood stain provides an alternative to painting a piece of furniture while emphasizing its natural color and texture. When using interior wood stains, mastering how to apply stain can give any wood surface a whole new look.\n- As you figure out how to stain wood, remember that stains add color, but don’t protect the wood. To prevent damage from water, light and everyday use, you’ll need to add a finish to the wood.\n- To find all the stains you need to complete your project, shop using [The Home Depot Mobile App](https://www.homedepot.com/c/SF_Mobile_Shopping)."}

This will ensure you have the clean, uncut edge at the threshold.\n- Begin the first row of flooring by placing the planks with the tongue side facing the wall.
