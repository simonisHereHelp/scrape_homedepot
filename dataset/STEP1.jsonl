Oak is a light-colored wood that has varying undertones. [Red oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Red-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11uq9) has pink undertones, [white oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/White-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z117p3) has yellow and gold undertones and [French oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/French-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z0m8y8) has gray undertones. White and French oak are both slightly tougher than red oak, which is more prone to scratches.\n- [Hickory](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Hickory/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11e6m): An extremely hard and durable wood, hickory is another very popular choice for flooring. It’s more durable than oak, making it a good choice for rooms with heavy traffic. Hickory is a light- to medium-toned wood with contrasting stripes in its natural pattern.\n- [Maple](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Maple/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11xzp): Maple has an even texture and pattern, which makes it a good choice for sleek, stained floors. It’s naturally light-toned but can be stained a wide variety of colors. Note that if you don’t want to stain and finish a floor yourself, most engineered wood floors come pre-stained and finished from a manufacturer. Maple is tougher than oak, but not quite as tough as hickory.\n- [Birch](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Birch/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11dkr): Like oak, birch wood also comes in multiple varieties—yellow birch and red birch.

Birch is a good choice for rooms with medium to heavy foot traffic.\n- [Bamboo](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Bamboo-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbrfe): While not technically wood, bamboo makes an excellent flooring material that has the look and texture of real wood. Its strength and durability can vary between manufacturers, but it’s typically more durable than the hardwoods in this list. Bamboo flooring can be refinished, stained and installed just like any other engineered wood flooring. Plus, bamboo is an eco-friendly renewable resource."}

[Underlayment](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Flooring-Supplies-Surface-Prep-Underlayment/N-5yc1vZcdtw) is a thin material placed between the flooring and the subfloor. It helps absorb noise, adds insulation and protects both the flooring and subfloor from water damage. It also helps correct uneven subfloors. Most wood flooring requires an underlayment, but some engineered wood floors have an attached underlayment.\n- To choose the color of your engineered hardwood flooring, decide whether you want light, medium or dark toned wood.\n- [Light engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Light/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7p): Light tones brighten rooms and have an airy and open aesthetic. They’re great for minimalist and coastal styles but may show dirt more easily.\n- [Medium engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Medium/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7u): These traditional wood tones match most home decor styles. Medium toned wood floors are the most popular choice with the widest selection of flooring. They can have warm or cool undertones.\n- [Dark engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Dark/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7j): These luxurious wood tones can make rooms feel cozy and welcoming. Dark floors are great for many styles of homes from modern to traditional. Dark wood can include cool, nearly black tones or warm red tones.\n- Alternatively, narrow down your choice by searching for specific color families: brown, red, gray, tan, white, black are some examples.\n- Textured engineered wood flooring already has dents, scuffs and simulated damage of varying degrees on the plank surface. There’s less need to worry about actual damage from daily wear and tear. Plus, textured flooring will need less maintenance than non-textured flooring. Note that if you resurface textured floors, you’ll lose some of its initial texture.\n- [Smooth](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Smooth/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n40): Smooth floors have a sleek and shiny finish that shows a wood pattern without the surface texture.

You want to make sure you don’t use too much thinset, because it will seep through the tiles. Also, make sure you check your tiles CONSTANTLY to assure you have what we call “the flower” or else you could end up with a floor that shows the square sheets of penny tile. I removed the tiles, added thinset and secured them row by row until the entire room was done. I let this dry overnight.

Then I marked each of the white tiles with a little dot, so I knew which ones to remove. I used a flat head screwdriver and popped up the marked tiles. Once they were up, I cleaned out any excess dried thinset. I then added the black penny tiles. To do this, I put thinset into a Ziplock bag and cut the tip (like you would apply icing on a cake). This allowed me to squeeze out a little on each tile and press onto the floor. Read the label on your thinset to determine how long it needs to dry before grouting.

Also, be sure to refresh your water constantly, if it looks “milky” the grout could adhere to the top of your tile, making your end project look very messy. Once the entire floor is grouted, refer to the products suggested drying time. If you have any grout haze, you can use a grout haze remover.

Also, always make sure your first piece is completely level, as it is the template that you will be basing your entire room on. Make sure you get wallpaper smoother and razor blade to smooth it out and cut off excess wallpaper. PRO TIP: Always order EXTRA wallpaper, because running out is no fun! And you can always return any roles that you do not use. For the vertical boards as well as the floor trim, I used one-by-six trim boards. I decided to use my sprayer to spray these all at once. Next, I installed my floor trim in which I used a miter saw to create my 45-degree cuts. After the floor trim was installed, I was ready to install my vertical boards. I highly suggest laying them out before installing them. I used a spare board as a spacer to make sure they were evenly distributed.

Begin by measuring the length of each wall and calculating the dimensions for your box trim.\n- Consider factors like spacing and preferred height for each box trim element. For instance, I aimed for a 5-inch spacing gap from walls and baseboards, with a desired lower box trim height of 20 inches.\n- Using these preferences, I calculated the height of the upper box trim by subtracting the total spacing gaps from the ceiling height, minus the height of the lower box trim. This gave me a height of 68 inches for each piece. To calculate the width, subtract the total wall width from the number of spacing gaps, then divide by the desired number of box trim designs.\n- For example, on my 98-inch-wide wall, I wanted two box trim designs. So, subtracting 15 inches for gaps, I divided the remaining 83 inches by two, resulting in 41.5 inches for each box trim width. Apply these width calculations consistently across all walls for uniformity."}
