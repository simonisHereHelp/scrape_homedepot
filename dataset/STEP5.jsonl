Water lightly with a small watering can or spray bottle. Avoid watering so much that water collects in the bottom.\\n- Trying adding small tools, shells or other decorations to your terrarium, if desired. Small children’s toys, like plastic dinosaurs, to make a fun “prehistoric jungle” terrarium.\\n- Keep your terrarium out of direct sunlight, so the sun coming through the glass won’t burn the plants. Prune them when needed and rotate the terrarium occasionally, so they don’t lean in just one direction.\"}"

The goal is to achieve even coverage, with no drips. Press lightly on the roller to prevent drips and lines.\\n- Reload the roller and paint the next section.

If you have to paint large, open indoor areas, such as warehouses, The Home Depot has scissor lifts for rent that can rise up to 40 feet.\\n- Be sure to follow the sprayer’s operations manual for all steps. Practice first, using a piece of scrap drywall or cardboard. This will allow you to use the sprayer correctly, using a smooth, back-and-forth motion. You can also figure out the distance needed for proper coverage.\\n- Always begin your stroke movement before using the trigger to release paint. Then, end the stroke after releasing the trigger. Doing this prevents paint from building up on the surface. Regularly wiping your paint sprayer nozzle with a rag prevents clogging.\\n- When using a sprayer, first paint corners and complex areas. You can then move on to flat surfaces, working top to bottom.\\n- Once your project is completed, let the paint dry for 24-48 hours. Next, remove the painter’s tape and drop cloths. You can then move your furniture back into the room and continue designing.\\n- Make sure you return your paint sprayer rental clean. When finished, clean the entire paint sprayer, as per the operations manual. If work remains, pour the leftover paint back into the can and clean the machine before storing.\"}"

The stringer may also be hidden by a skirtboard for decoration. Floating stairs may not have stringers at all.\n- Treads: These are the part of the stairs that you step on.\n- Risers: When you’re walking up your staircase, and your toe hits a vertical board, this board is called a riser. It’s a vertical piece that’s between each tread. Risers aren’t included for floating staircases, so that vertical space is left empty.\n- Handrail/Banister: You hold on to this part of the stairs. Sometimes there is one handrail, and sometimes there are handrails on both sides of the stairs.\n- Newel posts: These are vertical pieces at the bottom and the top of a staircase. The handrail is attached to the posts.\n- Baluster: Most stairs have vertical spindles or thin pieces that run the length of the stairs between the newel posts. They add stability and also work to keep bigger items from falling off the stairs on the sides. The handrail is also attached to balusters."}

An extended hose, upholstery tools and crevice tools are all helpful. Consider additional features like separate tanks for water and [floor cleaning products](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Floor-Care-Floor-Cleaning-Products/N-5yc1vZbzju).

The machines with removable brushes, tools and hoses are easier to maintain than those that you need to lift, turn upside down or reach deep inside of to clean.\n- Tank-Size: The larger the tank, the more space you can clean with your machine. It will decrease the amount of times you will need to change out the water.\n- Proper Ventilation: Even the best home carpet cleaners can be loud, and some cleaners can also exude fumes. Be sure to open a window while cleaning and always wear ear protection."}
