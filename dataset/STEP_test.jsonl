Some surfaces might require a specific sandpaper. Be sure to read the manufacturer's guidelines before sanding.\n- Wipe surfaces clean with a damp towel or sponge and let dry. A heavy-duty cleaner may help to remove dirt and grease from the walls and trim. Be sure to keep rags, buckets, water and paint sticks nearby for mixing. These will also come in handy for cleanup and mixing afterward.\n- Wear old clothes and a hat while painting.\n- Make sure you have rubber gloves and eye protection on hand.\n- Whenever you start any interior house painting project, always work in a properly ventilated space. You must open all windows and doors. You should also use fans and proper safety gear, like a [respirator mask](/b/Safety-Equipment-Respirator-Masks/N-5yc1vZc25k) and ventilator.

Scraps of drywall also work fine to practice on. Take your time learning how to use a paint sprayer and have several pieces of scrap material on hand.\n- Try various vertical and horizontal spraying movements to get a consistent pattern of paint onto the surface of the scrap material. You want the surface to achieve a uniform look when using a paint sprayer.\n- Holding the spray gun close to a surface applies more paint and creates a narrower spray pattern. Practice holding the spray gun closer to the surface for that result.\n- Holding the gun farther away from the surface creates a thinner coat of paint and a wider spray pattern. Work on how to use a paint sprayer to create that result, as well.\n- If you hold the sprayer too far away, the paint can dry before it reaches the surface. If that happens, you might need to respray the surface and take even more time to complete the project. Also, your paint supply won’t last as long."}

Available in many colors and textures. [Leather sofas and couches](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-Sofas-Couches/Leather/N-5yc1vZc7oyZ1z0jjgr) are easily cleaned, with stain-resistant finishes.

Soft, nubby texture. Stylish, casual and fun. Easily maintained.\n- Textured weave: Soft and nubby like boucle, but chunkier and stronger. Offers an attractive, natural feel. Works well in busy homes.\n- Linen: Provides a soft texture cool to the touch. Simple clean-up.\n- Cotton: Good, breezy linen alternative. Can be treated and resist stains.\n- Denim: A durable cotton alternative. Absorbs stains and colors faster. Resists pilling, the breakdown of fabric fibers, which causes small fuzzballs.\n- Canvas: Another durable cotton alternative. Offers a more casual and relaxed style.\n- Chenille: Has a soft, silky and plush feel, like velvet. Durable, unless exposed to direct sunlight, so place sofas away from windows.\n- Wool and wool blends: Durable, with little wrinkling or piling. Easily spot-cleaned or vacuumed. Recommended for homes with children. Good heat retention.\n- Acrylic: A synthetic wool. Resists wear and tear, fading, wrinkling and discoloration.\n- Polyester: A non-allergenic, synthetic fiber that looks and feels like leather.

Use a scraper or putty knife to loosen an edge of the wallpaper at the corner of a room and carefully try to pull off a strip. Removable wallpaper should peel off easily.\n- Strippable wallpaper is designed to last longer than removable wallpaper, but softens easily when soaked with hot water.\n- Wallpapers designed to be water resistant or washable, such as vinyl wallpapers, need a stronger method, such as a chemical [wallpaper remover](/b/Paint-Wallpaper-Remover/N-5yc1vZ2fkot80).\n- Gel removers are less messy than liquid removers and can be more effective in removing wallpaper that has been applied to unprimed drywall or has used clay-based adhesives.\n- Wallpaper steamers can be used on any wallpaper and may be the only recourse with old, stubborn wallpapers that are hard to remove.

I am adding a border and words in the middle! First, I did a dry fit, laying all the tile out, except for the letters – that will come later. After I was confident in my layout, I started removing a row of tiles in the back of the bathroom. I used a [trowel](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Anvil-3-16-in-x-5-32-in-V-Notch-Economy-Flooring-Trowel-10115ANV/310779434 \"Anvil 3/16 in. x 5/32 in.

White Premixed Thinset Mortar\") onto the concrete. I then carefully placed my tiles back and pressed them into the thinset. You want to make sure you don’t use too much thinset, because it will seep through the tiles. Also, make sure you check your tiles CONSTANTLY to assure you have what we call “the flower” or else you could end up with a floor that shows the square sheets of penny tile. I removed the tiles, added thinset and secured them row by row until the entire room was done. I let this dry overnight. For the letters, I first placed the [black penny tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/p/MSI-Nero-Penny-Round-12-in-x-13-in-Matte-Porcelain-Mesh-Mounted-Mosaic-Tile-14-4-sq-ft-case-PT-PENRD-NEROM/306065589 \"MSI Nero Penny Round 12 in. x 13 in.

Then I marked each of the white tiles with a little dot, so I knew which ones to remove. I used a flat head screwdriver and popped up the marked tiles. Once they were up, I cleaned out any excess dried thinset. I then added the black penny tiles. To do this, I put thinset into a Ziplock bag and cut the tip (like you would apply icing on a cake). This allowed me to squeeze out a little on each tile and press onto the floor. Read the label on your thinset to determine how long it needs to dry before grouting. Once dry, you are ready for [grout](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-SimpleGrout-640-Arctic-White-1-gal-Pre-Mixed-Grout-PMG6401-2/319229605 \"Custom Building Products SimpleGrout #640 Arctic White 1 gal.

Using a [grout float](https://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-4-in-x-10-5-in-XL-Non-Stick-Gum-Rubber-Grout-Float-with-Wood-Handle-10070/310829257 \"QEP 4 in. x 10.5 in. XL Non-Stick Gum Rubber Grout Float with Wood Handle\"), scoop the grout out and press it into the tile. Make sure you angle the grout float to remove excess grout. Do this in small areas as you do not want to leave the grout on the tile for too long. Use water and sponges to wipe off any remaining excess grout. Also, be sure to refresh your water constantly, if it looks “milky” the grout could adhere to the top of your tile, making your end project look very messy. Once the entire floor is grouted, refer to the products suggested drying time. If you have any grout haze, you can use a grout haze remover. Once you’re happy with the look of your tile and grout, go ahead and seal it.\n- ![A person installing the penny tiles on the floor.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/Get04AiI_hhkQ_AWjP-9mg/S_FOfFEsy9PEaiHtJSpfzQ/Original%20file/JordanMiller-JordanMillerHome-FY24HDC-BasementBathroomMakeover-BlogPhoto-7.jpg)![A close-up of the penny tiles.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/X6-2w68MB1sAygMbGETzrQ/2Pg_-ClPwDX3RZ8-MvVUHg/Original%20file/JordanMiller-JordanMillerHome-FY24HDC-BasementBathroomMakeover-BlogPhoto-8.jpg)![Overview of the penny tiles during the installation.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/VSeCtCxOF8VbmQIJbOW8WA/ozUtMzqFJ2izsbCvrTx8dQ/Original%20file/JordanMiller-JordanMillerHome-FY24HDC-BasementBathroomMakeover-BlogPhoto-9.jpg)![Overview of the completed penny tiles.](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/228pTeLLgK8oXaxVjA9jmg/nwCUzrc8iSCtr4486GrLZw/Original%20file/JordanMiller-JordanMillerHome-FY24HDC-BasementBathroomMakeover-BlogPhoto-10.jpg)"}

These install methods  \n- Vinyl finishes include no-wax, urethane or enhanced urethane. Each offers stain-resistance and a nice shine that does not require polishing or buffing.\n- When shopping for your vinyl flooring, keep the wear layer in mind. This is the top surface of your flooring, usually made of a clear, polyurethane coat. The wear layer makes the flooring waterproof, scratch- and/or stain-resistant. Thickness ranges between 4 to 40 millimeters, with a thicker wear layer making more sense for homes with pets, kids and high traffic.\n- Luxury [vinyl plank flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbzjz) is made to look like hardwood, and [vinyl tile flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Tile-Flooring/N-5yc1vZaq27) is made to look like high-end stones such as marble.

Not the most fun part of a renovation, but it really is important. I started by removing any existing screws from the walls. I am going to add new [pendant lights](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Renee-1-Light-Aged-Brass-and-Black-Pendant-Light-with-Opal-Glossy-Shade-H344701-AGB-BK/311691187 \"Renee 1-Light Aged Brass and Black Pendant Light with Opal Glossy Shade\") above the vanity, so I had my electrician come and rewire the lighting so the lights could be hung from the ceiling. Next, I patched all my holes. You will want to patch any holes or imperfections with spackle, let dry, repeat if needed and sand until smooth. Even if you are covering the walls with wallpaper, they need to be smooth first, otherwise you will see imperfections through the wallpaper. After patching, make sure to prime your walls. Wallpaper will not stick to drywall or spackle. If you are painting your walls, you will still need to prime to ensure the paint covers evenly. You’ll want to check the condition of the subfloor to ensure it’s in good shape before moving on to your new flooring choice. Since we are working in the basement, I’m dealing with concrete so that makes it easy on me! Since there was carpet in this bathroom a zillion years ago (gross I know), I did have to scrape up some residue. I used my [Husky 15-in-one tool](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-15-in-1-Painters-Multi-Tool-with-Stainless-Steel-Blade-91004/326354449 \"Husky 15-in-1 Painters Multi-Tool with Stainless Steel Blade\") and everything came up easily."}

With that said, you can count on The Home Depot to provide expert knowledge and insight that’s only a click, phone call or short drive away. In addition to my research online, The Home Depot’s large LifeProof flooring display really helped me make a great flooring decision for our family.\n- We are a large family that includes four very energetic kids ranging from 11 to 4. When it comes to the needs of our family, health is the number one concern. When I discovered that LifeProof Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring has no phthalates or formaldehyde, it went to the top of my list of choices.\n- Like most families with kids, we are also a family of spills! Drink spills happen every day, all day for us. Sometimes, these spills aren’t reported to mom and dad.

Clean-up is as simple as using a dust mop, vacuum, or a pH-neutral cleaner. It’s also scratch-resistant, which is nice. But we fully expect to deal with marks and scratches from our VERY active kiddos."}

But really, I do like a lot of shelves in the shower so soap and shampoo bottles don’t end up on the floor.\n- We installed three of these cool [corner shelves](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Bath-Accessories-White-8-in-x-8-in-Ceramic-Wall-Mounted-Corner-Shelf-0100BA7801P/100674432). I’m not going to lie, I was intimidated by these shelves when I first saw them. They are pretty heavy duty, and I thought there was no way they were going to stay on the wall with just thinset. But I was wrong! They are really amazing and super easy to install.\n- ![How To Tile a Basement Shower](https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-tile-a-basement-shower-image-12.jpg)\n- The shelf actually sits on the tile below it, and the tile above it slides behind the shelf, so it stays put! When we got to the row where we wanted the shelf, we installed the shelf first, with a layer of thinset, then tiled the row meeting up to it. That way we knew exactly what size to cut our tile. We did have to cut a couple of tiles in sort of an L-shape to have it fit up to the shelf, but the coolest part is that the tile slides in behind the shelf, so you can’t see the edge of the cut tile behind it.\n- Our bottom shelf was installed about 2 feet from the shower floor, and the top shelves just shy of 4 feet from the shower floor.\n- We were big fans of [these shelves](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Bath-Accessories-White-8-in-x-8-in-Ceramic-Wall-Mounted-Corner-Shelf-0100BA7801P/100674432)."}

Always measure doorways and stairways before placing your furniture order.\n- Know the height, width and depth for the furniture that you want in your space. This can be found in the product details in the online description.\n- Measure doorways, pathways and stairways to your home. If there are elevators and hallways, get those measurements, too, including the elevator door opening. These measurements must be greater than the furniture dimensions in order for the furniture to be moved into your space.\n- When measuring, you’ll want to use the interior measurement of the doorways, passageways and hallways. Note the placement of architectural details like doorknobs, light fixtures and trim like chair rail on your sketch.\n- Tip: Measure twice for accuracy. Ask a friend to help with running the tape measure and making sketches.\n- Properly measuring your room for furniture will help you design a comfortable living space and will save aggravation with furniture delivery.\n- With proper planning and precise measurements, you can get the right size furniture for your space. Start by measuring the entryway for delivery. Always measure twice to avoid issues down the road.\n- Use [The Home Depot Mobile App](https://www.homedepot.com/c/SF_Mobile_Shopping) to locate products and check inventory.

What’s next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 2: What is Backer Board?\n- [Cement board](/b/Building-Materials-Drywall-Cement-Boards/N-5yc1vZcb0f), often referred to as backer board, is a thin layer of concrete with fiberglass mesh on both sides. It’s available in sheets of many sizes. Most projects need 3-foot by 5-foot sheets.\n- Whenever you’re laying tile on a wood subfloor, you need to first install cement backer board. Backer board prevents leaks and water damage that could harm your flooring and the structure of your home. Unlike wood or drywall sub-surfaces, cement backer board will not rot, warp or grow mold and mildew when exposed to water. That’s the main reason they’re a go-to choice for permanent installations like this.\n- Another reason you’ll need to work with cement backer board is that it’s never safe to install new tiles over existing tiles. You also can’t safely install tile flooring over plywood subfloor or onto an unprotected wood floor. If you did, there'd be a serious risk of rot, water damage, warping and mold. Plus, your tile and grout would likely crack."}

Before you start adding the pattern to your tiles, practice stencil painting on a piece of cardboard.  \n- Start with a clean tile floor. Priming the tile will help the stencil paint stick to it.\n- Plan the pattern so it will match the tiled space you want to paint. Use painter’s tape to cover the edges of the area.\n- Begin stenciling on one of the edges. Work on one tile at a time. Lay the stencil on the tile. Use painter’s tape to secure the stencil. You can apply the paint with a brush or a sponge.  \n- The key to pretty stenciling is using the right amount of paint. Dab a little paint onto the stencil and tile at a time, adding more if you need to.\n- When you’re done painting the pattern, allow plenty of time to let it dry. Depending on how you’re working, you may need to let one stencil dry before adding the next."}

Plus, engineered wood flooring typically is available in a vast variety of colors, textures and sizes.\n- Durable: Engineered wood flooring has a stable construction that withstands natural temperature and moisture changes. Most types can be refinished at least once if they get too damaged.\n- Light-resistant: Most types of engineered wood floors are UV-resistant, so they won’t fade from the sun.\n- Mold-resistant: While not all types of engineered wood floors are fully waterproof, engineered wood is more waterproof than other flooring materials. Not only does it resist warping and water damage, it also resists mold growth.\n- Easy to maintain: Engineered wood floors are easy to clean and are usually pre-finished with a protective coating that doesn’t require additional coats of finish or shine.\n- Multiple installation options: Unlike solid hardwood, engineered wood floors can be installed below-grade, over concrete subfloors and heated floors. They can also be installed with multiple different methods, which are covered in the next section.\n- Lower cost: Engineered wood flooring is slightly more budget friendly per square foot than solid hardwood, while still looking like solid hardwood."}

This process is known as \"cutting in.\"\n- For best results, work in one small area at a time.\n- You may want to follow the process of \"edging painting.\" This involves cutting in the wall's edges before painting rolling or painting the entire wall. Doing so prevents the borders from drying before you finish painting the wall. It also keeps the sheen uniform. If edging, use an angled brush to apply a thick coat.\n- Choose the right roller cover for your wall surface and place it onto your [paint roller](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Rollers/N-5yc1vZaqpy). For smooth ceilings, use a low nap roller. For a textured ceiling, use a thicker roller, with a 1/2-inch or 3/4-inch nap.\n- Pour primer into a paint tray.\n- Dip the roller into the paint, making sure it’s completely covered.\n- Roll the paint roller over the ridged area of the [paint tray](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Trays-and-Liners/N-5yc1vZaqcd) a few times to remove excess paint.\n- With a fully loaded paint roller, work top to bottom. Roll it back and forth across the wall in a series of V- or W-shaped strokes.\n- Roll in one section at a time, moving from top to bottom and from one side of the wall to the other. The goal is to achieve even coverage, with no drips. Press lightly on the roller to prevent drips and lines.\n- Reload the roller and paint the next section. Cover only as much as you can finish while the primer is still wet. Overlap areas of wet primer only."}

{"prompt": "You are a procedural assistant trained to guide users through technical SOPs step-by-step with clarity and context.\n\n### User:\nWhat is Step 11 for Painting a Room?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 11: Using a Paint Sprayer\n- When picking a paint, it should flow smoothly through the sprayer. Airless paint sprayer rentals use oil-based paints. They’re better than latex or water-based paints, which can be thicker and clog machines.\n- Have all necessary painting tools and equipment ready before starting a project. Besides the normal materials, you may need special items. For instance, a fiberglass twin stepladder or scaffold set may help for higher walls and ceilings. If you have to paint large, open indoor areas, such as warehouses, The Home Depot has scissor lifts for rent that can rise up to 40 feet.\n- Be sure to follow the sprayer’s operations manual for all steps. Practice first, using a piece of scrap drywall or cardboard. This will allow you to use the sprayer correctly, using a smooth, back-and-forth motion. You can also figure out the distance needed for proper coverage.\n- Always begin your stroke movement before using the trigger to release paint. Then, end the stroke after releasing the trigger. Doing this prevents paint from building up on the surface. Regularly wiping your paint sprayer nozzle with a rag prevents clogging.\n- When using a sprayer, first paint corners and complex areas. You can then move on to flat surfaces, working top to bottom.\n- Once your project is completed, let the paint dry for 24-48 hours. Next, remove the painter’s tape and drop cloths. You can then move your furniture back into the room and continue designing.\n- Make sure you return your paint sprayer rental clean. When finished, clean the entire paint sprayer, as per the operations manual. If work remains, pour the leftover paint back into the can and clean the machine before storing."}

What's next?\n\n### Assistant:\n", "completion": "Step 3: Engineered Wood vs. Solid Hardwood\n- ![Alt Text Here](https://dam.thdstatic.com/content/production/Vhzle8SxGqW3QgxFPrFIIQ/rXKngK9-dWsRBovc2wyb9g/Original%20file/best-engineered-hardwood-flooring-for-your-home-section-2.jpg)\n- Solid hardwood flooring planks are made entirely from a single piece of hardwood. Engineered wood flooring planks, by contrast, are made up of several layers of composite wood, with a thin veneer of solid hardwood on top. Both are great flooring options, depending on your needs.\n- Because its entire thickness is high quality wood, solid hardwood flooring can be sanded down and refinished many times. This ability gives it a much longer lifespan than engineered wood floors. With the right installation and care, solid hardwood can last a literal lifetime, anywhere from 30 to 100 years. However, solid hardwood is prone to warping from temperature and moisture changes, so it should only be installed above-grade. Wider solid hardwood planks may also need to be glued and nailed down to a wood subfloor to prevent movement.\n- Engineered wood flooring can also be refinished if it has a thick hardwood veneer. Thinner veneers typically can’t be refinished, so the flooring only has a lifespan of up to 30 years. Thick veneers can help engineered wood flooring last up to 80 years. Engineered wood planks are also sturdier and less likely to warp over time, so they can be installed below-grade and over wood or concrete subfloors.\n- When it comes to cost, solid hardwood is typically more expensive per square foot than engineered hardwood. Higher quality engineered hardwood can get as expensive as a mid- to upper-range solid hardwood, but the labor for installing either type of flooring is usually the same and makes up the bulk of the cost.\n- Tip: Both engineered and solid hardwood floors can make a home more appealing to future buyers and add resale value."}
