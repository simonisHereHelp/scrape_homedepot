Use safety equipment and follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using any wood stain. Don’t mix different types of stains while working on a project.\n- If you’re focusing on how to stain a wood table or other large pieces of furniture, oil-based stain is typically a good choice. Because they take more time to dry, [oil-based wood stains](/b/Paint-Interior-Wood-Stains/Oil-Based/N-5yc1vZbo8pZ1z1p6ug) come out more evenly. They’re also more durable.

When using interior wood stains, mastering how to apply stain can give any wood surface a whole new look.\n- As you figure out how to stain wood, remember that stains add color, but don’t protect the wood.

We started with the shower floor. Because I didn’t want to have to cut tiles to match the slope of the shower pan, I used these adorable little [penny tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Finesse-Glossy-White-12-in-x-13-in-x-6-35-mm-Porcelain-Penny-Round-Mosaic-Wall-Tile-1-06-sq-ft-piece-FE0811PNYRDHD1P/300049525). Installing them was really easy.

You will spread a layer of [thinset](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-VersaBond-White-50-lbs-Fortified-Thinset-Mortar-MTSW50/100091767) with the notched side of your [trowel](https://www.homedepot.com/p/HDX-9-in-x-3-8-in-x-1-4-in-Square-Notch-Economy-Flooring-Trowel-10114X/203713870), then lay your tile. Take your time on these penny tiles. Because you don’t use spacers, you’ll need to be very deliberate and careful to make sure everything stays straight and level. You’ll also need to cut the tile to fit your drain.

These products can be applied to any masonry surface.\n- Film-forming coatings: These masonry products resemble paint finishes—from sheen to satin to gloss. These products resist water pressure behind the film they create when applied. Use film-forming coatings to seal leaky basement walls.

If it’s a new wood surface, you can skip the cleaning process.\n- Sand down wood: After the surface is dry, give it a good sanding with rough sandpaper or with a [sander](/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Sanders/N-5yc1vZc28s) to tackle any imperfections. Finish with finer sandpaper to make it smooth and even. Wipe the surface thoroughly to remove any sanding residue.\n- Choose the right stain or sealant: Most sealants and stains are sold for the application you need it for.

Allow the surface to dry for four to ten hours, depending on the product's instructions.\n- Sand the surface: To form an effective waterproof barrier, you will have to apply multiple coats of stain or sealant.
