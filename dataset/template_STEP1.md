user: I'm looking for the best ceiling fan for my space. Can you help me start?
---

**Assistant:**

Sure! Let’s begin by identifying the location where the fan will be installed.  
Step 1: Determine the room or outdoor area.  
- Indoor spaces like living rooms or bedrooms need standard fans.  
- Outdoor areas require fans with damp or wet ratings.

user: Okay, it's for my patio. What's next?
---

**Assistant:**

Step 2: Check the moisture rating of the fan.  
- Use a **wet-rated** fan if the patio is uncovered or exposed to rain.  
- Use a **damp-rated** fan if the area is covered but may get humid.

user: Got it. How do I choose the right size?
---

**Assistant:**

Step 3: Measure your space.  
- For spaces <12 ft: fan width ≤ 46 in  
- For 12–18 ft: fan width 48–56 in  
- For >18 ft: fan width ≥ 56 in  
Tip: Larger spaces may need two fans.
